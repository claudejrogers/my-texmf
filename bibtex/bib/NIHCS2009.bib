	Abstract = {Ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with Grubbs's catalyst was used to synthesize narrow polydispersity (PDI)diblock copolymers of norbornene (NOR) and norbornenedicarboxylic acid (NORCOOH). Norbornene (NOR) and 5-norbornene-2,3,-dicarboxylic acid his trimethylsilyl ester (NORCOOTMS) were used as precursor monomers for thepolymerization. [NORCOOTMS](m)/[NOR](n) was converted to [NORCOOH](m)/[NOR](n) by precipitating the polymer solution in a mixture of methanol, acetic acid, and water. The conversion to 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid was evidenced by H-1 NMR. By polymerizing the bulkier NORCOOTMS precursor monomer first, lower PDIs were observed for the completed [NORCOOH](m)/[NOR](n) block copolymers in comparison to copolymers where the NOR block was polymerized first. The PDI of the diblock copolymers of [NORCOOH](m)/[NOR](n) decreased with increase in block length of the precursor NORCOOTMS monomer. This study shows that the PDI can be controlled by selecting a monomer with appropriate functionality as the starting block of the block copolymer to control the rate of propagation, R, as an alternative of using additives to change the reactivity of the catalyst.

The degree of sulfation was easily controlled by changing the amt. of DMF/SO3 complex added and reaction time. The total human blood clotting time in the presence of poly(GEMA) sulfate was prolonged by increasing the dose or the degree of sulfation of the polymer. The anticoagulant activity of poly(GEMA) sulfate was also compared with that of dextran sulfate, poly(styrenesulfonic acid), poly(vinylsulfuric acid), and heparin. The result suggests that sulfated saccharide residues are essential for endowing anticoagulant activity to synthetic polymer. [on SciFinder (R)]},

@article{alshawi07,
	Abstract = {Several studies have sought to demonstrate that neurodegeneration during disease and in old age is associated with reduced neurotrophic support. Little positive evidence has been forthcoming, either in relation to the availability of neurotrophins or to expression and function of the relevant receptors. Recently, a novel way in which neurotrophins could contribute to neurodegeneration has been suggested. In contrast to the well-known neurotrophic functions of the mature beta-form of nerve growth factor (mNGF), its precursor proNGF has recently been shown to be abundant in the adult brain and in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. proNGF is synthesized as 25 and 32 kDa isoforms, which are glycosylated to form a principal 40 kDa species. Studies of the cortical targets of NGF-responsive basal forebrain neurons show that the 40 kDa form of proNGF is secreted in response to nerve stimulation, along with the proteases needed to generate the 13 kDa mNGF, or to degrade it. We have recently found that levels of 40 kDa proNGF are elevated in the aging brain and also in targets of peripheral NGF-responsive neurons. proNGF has been shown to be neurotoxic when bound in a heterotrimer with the p75 receptor and the receptor sortilin (identical to the neurotensin receptor NTS3). Interestingly, we find that sortilin levels increase in aged central and peripheral neurons, perhaps making these neurons more vulnerable to age-related increases in proNGF. Whether elevated levels of proNGF in targets or of sortilin in neurons contribute to known patterns of age- and disease-related neurodegeneration has not been previously investigated. Using in vitro models, our preliminary data now indicate that proNGF is indeed neurotoxic for aged, but not young, NGF-responsive basal forebrain and sympathetic neurons and that blockade of sortilin rescues proNGF-induced cell death. We therefore propose that increased proNGF in targets combined with increased sortilin expression in projecting neurons contributes to age-related neuronal atrophy and degeneration.},

@article{alonso04,
	Abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent modulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the CNS, acting both pre- and postsynaptically. We demonstrated recently that BDNF/TrkB signaling increases dendritic spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, we tested whether activation of the prominent ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway was responsible for BDNF's effects on spine growth. Slice cultures were transfected with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) by particle-mediated gene transfer, and CA1 pyramidal neurons were imaged by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. We confirmed that BDNF (24 h) increases spine density in apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. The MEK (ERK kinase) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 completely prevented the increase in spine density induced by. BDNF, without having an effect on spine density by themselves. In contrast to its actions on cortical pyramidal neurons, BDNF had minor and rather localized effects on dendritic complexity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, increasing the total length, but not the branching of apical dendrites within CA1 stratum radiatum, without affecting basal dendrites in stratum oriens. Our results support the hypothesis that the ERK-signaling pathway not only mediates long-term synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning, but it is also involved in the structural remodeling of excitatory spine synapses triggered by neurotrophins.},

Compound 5 was obtained from N-acetylglucosamine 1 following sequential protecting group strategy and C-4 epimerization as a key step. Carboxylic acid functionalized T-antigen derivative 15, obtained by radical addition of 3-mercaptopropionic acid to allyl disaccharide 10, was conjugated to PAMAM dendritic cores 13-16 by an efficient amide coupling strategy using TBTU. GlycoPAMAM dendrimers having T-antigen residues with 4, 8, 16 and 32 valencies (17-20) were obtained in 73 to 99% yields. Their protein binding properties were demonstrated using peanut lectin from Arachis hypogaea and a mouse monoclonal IgG antibody. The higher valency conjugates generated stronger binding interactions indicating a cluster effect. The inhibitory potential of these glycoPAMAM conjugates toward antibody-coating antigen interactions was enhanced up to 3800 times over that of the monomeric T-antigen residue (10).

Multivalent inhibitors containing the three amino acid binding sequence of fertilin beta, ECD, have been shown previously to be more effective inhibitors of fertilization than their monovalent counterparts. Here, we probed sperm-egg interactions with ruthenium-catalyzed ring-opening metathesis polymers that contained from 3 to 70 ECD pharmacophores in densities ranging from 10% to 100%. Evaluation of the polymer potencies, and synthesis of a triblock copolymer from two building blocks, revealed that two multivalent contacts are sufficient for maximal inhibition, and that the distance between ECD pharmacophores required is 7-9 monomers spanning 4-5 nm. We conclude that inhibition requires recruitment of two receptors on the egg surface into an inhibitory complex.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian brains contain significant amts. of chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and CS/DS hybrid chains. CS/DS chains isolated from embryonic pig brains (E-CS/DS) promote the outgrowth of neurites in embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons in culture by interacting with pleiotrophin (PTN), a heparin-binding growth factor. Here, we analyzed oligosaccharides isolated from E-CS/DS, which showed that octasaccharides were the minimal size capable of interacting with PTN at a physiol. salt concn. Five and eight sequences were purified from fluorescently labeled PTN-bound and -unbound octasaccharide fractions, resp., by enzymic digestion followed by PTN-affinity chromatog. Their sequences were detd. by enzymic digestion in conjunction with high performance liq. chromatog., revealing a crit. role for oversulfated D and/or iD disaccharides in the low yet significant affinity for PTN, which is required for neuritogenesis. The crit. D and iD units are GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)b1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) and IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)a1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), resp., where IdoUA represents L-iduronic acid. In contrast, high affinity interactions with PTN required decasaccharides with E units (GlcUAb1-3GalNAc(4, 6-O-disulfate)), B units (GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)b1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)), and/or their IdoUA-contg. counterparts (iE and iB) in addn. to D/iD units, although the biol. significance of such strong interactions remains to be investigated. Thus, chain size and compn. are crucial to the interaction with PTN, and PTN binds to multiple sequences in E-CS/DS chains with distinct affinity. Notably, not only heparan sulfate but also CS/DS hybrid chain structures of mammalian brains contain a high degree of microheterogeneity with a cluster of oversulfated disaccharides and appear to play roles in regulating the functions of PTN.

	Abstract = {Hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate are glycosaminoglycans that play major roles in the biomechanical properties of a wide variety of tissues, including cartilage. A chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain can be divided into three regions: (1) a single linkage region oligosaccharide, through which the chain is attached to its proteoglycan core protein, (2) numerous internal repeat disaccharides, which comprise the bulk of the chain, and (3) a single nonreducing terminal saccharide structure. Each of these regions of a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain has its own level of microheterogeneity of structure, which varies with proteoglycan class, tissue source, species, and pathology. We have developed rapid, simple, and sensitive protocols for detection, characterization and quantitation of the saccharide structures from the internal disaccharide and nonreducing terminal regions of hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains. These protocols rely on the generation of saccharide structures with free reducing groups by specific enzymatic treatments (hyaluronidase/chondroitinase) which are then quantitatively tagged though their free reducing groups with the fluorescent reporter, 2-aminoacridone. These saccharide structures are further characterized by modification through additional enzymatic (sulfatase) or chemical (mercuric ion) treatments. After separation by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, the relative fluorescence in each band is quantitated with a cooled, charge-coupled device camera for analysis. Specifically, the digestion products identified are (1) unsaturated internal Deltadisaccharides including DeltaDiHA, DeltaDi0S, DeltaDi2S, DeltaDi4S, DeltaDi6S, DeltaDi2,4S, DeltaDi2,6S, DeltaDi4,6S, and DeltaDi2,4,6S; (2) saturated nonreducing terminal disaccharides including DiHA, Di0S, Di4S and Di6S; and (3) nonreducing terminal hexosamines including glcNAc, galNAc, 4S-galNAc, 6S-galNAc, and 4, 6S-galNAc.},

	Abstract = {We developed a method to extract differentially chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that are diffusely present in the central nervous system (CNS) matrix and CSPGs that are present in the condensed matrix of perineuronal nets (PNNs). Adult rat brain was sequentially extracted with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), TBS-containing detergent, 1 m NaCl, and 6 m urea. Extracting tissue sections with these buffers showed that the diffuse and membrane-bound CSPGs were extracted in the first three buffers, but PNN-associated CSPGs remained and were only removed by 6 m urea. Most of the CSPGs were extracted to some degree with all the buffers, with neurocan, brevican, aggrecan, and versican particularly associated with the stable urea-extractable PNNs. The CSPGs in stable complexes only extractable in urea buffer are found from postnatal day 7-14 coinciding with PNN formation. Disaccharide composition analysis indicated a different glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composition for PGs strongly associated with extracellular matrix (ECM). For CS/dermatan sulfate (DS)-GAG the content of nonsulfated, 6-O-sulfated, 2,6-O-disulfated, and 4,6-O-disulfated disaccharides were higher and for heparan sulfate (HS)-GAG, the content of 6-O-sulfated, 2-N-, 6-O-disulfated, 2-O-, 2-N-disulfated, and 2-O-, 2-N-, 6-O-trisulfated disaccharides were higher in urea extract compared with other buffer extracts. Digestions with chondroitinase ABC and hyaluronidase indicated that aggrecan, versican, neurocan, brevican, and phosphacan are retained in PNNs through binding to hyaluronan (HA). A comparison of the brain and spinal cord ECM with respect to CSPGs indicated that the PNNs in both parts of the CNS have the same composition.},

	Abstract = {We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops. Target- derived nerve growth factor ( NGF) promoted expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and prolonged TrkA- mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of brain- derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin- 4, which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF- TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF- TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. We suggest that three target- initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.},

The present routes are based on multiple regioselective acylation via the respective stannylene intermediates, followed by inversions to the corresponding manno- and talopyranoside structures by nitrite or acetate substitution. It was found that the ester group was able to induce the inversion of its two neighboring groups in high yields following either a double parallel or a double serial inversion process. By combination of direct inversion, and neighboring- as well as remote-group participation, several beta-D-mannoside and beta-D-taloside derivatives were very conveniently obtained in good yields.},

Both molecules bound similarly to a region of the bFGF surface containing residues asparagine-28, arginine-121, lysine-126, and glutamine-135; the hexasaccharide also interacted with an additional binding site formed by lysine-27, asparagine-102, and lysine-136.

These components form a FG F-FG FR-proteoglycan complex that activates the FGF-mediated signal transduction process through FGFR dimerization. Recent crystal structure determinations of FGF-heparin complexes have provided insights into both the interactions between these components and the role of heparin-like proteoglycans in FGF function. Future advances in this field will benefit enormously from an ability to specifically prepare homogenous heparin-based oligosaccharides of defined sequence for use in biochemical and structural studies of FGF and many other systems.},

	Abstract = {The cellular responses to spinal cord or brain injury include the production of molecules that modulate wound healing. This study examined the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, a family of molecules present in the wound healing matrix that may inhibit axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) after trauma. We have demonstrated increases in these putative inhibitory molecules in brain and spinal cord injury models, and we observed a close correlation between the tissue distribution of their upregulation and the presence of inflammation and a compromised blood-brain barrier. We determined that the presence of degenerating and dying axons injured by direct trauma does not provide a sufficient signal to induce the increases in proteoglycans observed after injury. Activated macrophages, their products, or other serum components that cross a compromised blood-brain barrier may provide a stimulus for changes in extracellular matrix molecules after CNS injury. While gliosis is associated with increased levels of proteoglycans, not all reactive astrocytes are associated with augmented amounts of these extracellular matrix molecules, which suggests a heterogeneity among glial cells that exhibit a reactive phenotype. Chondroitin sulfate also demarcates developing cavities of secondary necrosis, implicating these types of boundary molecules in the protective response of the CNS to trauma.

	Abstract = {Chondroitin sulfate K (CS-K) from king crab cartilage rich in rare 3-O-sulfated glucuronic acid (GlcUA(3S)) displayed neuritogenic activity and affinity toward various growth factors like CS-E from squid cartilage. CS-K-mediated neuritogenesis of mouse hippocampal neurons in culture was abolished by digestion with chondroitinase (CSase) ABC, indicating the possible involvement of GlcUA(3S). However, identification of GlcUA(3S) in CS chains by conventional high performance liquid chromatography has been hampered by its CSase ABC-mediated degradation. To investigate the degradation process, an authentic CS-E tetrasaccharide, Delta(4,5)HexUA-GalNAc(4S)GlcUA-(3S)-GalNAc(4S), was digested with CSase ABC, and the end product was identified as GalNAc(4S) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Putative GalNAc(6S) and GalNAc(4S, 6S), derived presumably from GlcUA(3S)GalNAc(6S) and GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S, 6S), respectively, were also detected by ESI-MS in the CSase ABC digest of a CS-E oligosaccharide fraction resistant to CSases AC-I and AC-II. Intermediates during the CSase ABC-mediated degradation of Delta(4,5)HexUA( 3S)-GalNAc(4S) to GalNAc(4S) were identified through ESI-MS of a partial CSase ABC digest of a CS-K tetrasaccharide, GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S), and the conceivable mechanism behind the degradation of the GlcUA(3S) moiety was elucidated. Although a fucose branch was also identified in CS-K, defucosylated CS-K exhibited greater neuritogenic activity than the native CS-K, excluding the possibility of the involvement of fucose in the activity. Rather, (3S)containing disaccharides are likely involved. These findings will enable us to detect GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides in CS chains to better understand CS-mediated biological processes.},

II could be polymd. by the less active Ph3PRu catalyst I; and the catalyst II initiated the polymn. of the other 4 monomers. Benzene is a more effective polymn. solvent than CH2Cl2 for the monomers except for III, for which CH2Cl2 is a better solvent and which is prone to gelation. The reaction rates are highly dependent upon the sugar protecting group and range from <5 min for III to 2-3 days for the triethylsilyl ether deriv. V. Narrow-dispersity materials were obtained using II when reactions were run at elevated temp. (50 Deg). For example, the polydispersity indexes of poly-IV and poly-V prepd. in benzene soln. at 50 Deg were 1.17 and 1.10, resp. More polydisperse products resulted from reactions at 25 Deg. Deprotonation of poly-III, poly-IV, and poly-V was also investigated. The silyl ether polymer, poly-V, was readily deprotected using tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF. Incomplete reaction and complex products were obsd. in preliminary attempts to remove the acetate and benzyl ether groups.

@article{Galtrey07,
	Abstract = {A review. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) consist of a core protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. There is enormous structural diversity among CSPGs due to variation in the core protein, the no. of GAG chains and the extent and position of sulfation. Most CSPGs are secreted from cells and participate in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). CSPGs are able to interact with various growth-active mols. and this may be important in their mechanism of action. In the normal central nervous system (CNS), CSPGs have a role in development and plasticity during postnatal development and in the adult. Plasticity is greatest in the young, esp. during crit. periods. CSPGs are crucial components of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs have a role in closure of the crit. period and digestion of PNNs allows their re-opening. In the adult, CSPGs play a part in learning and memory and the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. CSPGs have an important role in CNS injuries and diseases. After CNS injury, CSPGs are the major inhibitory component of the glial scar. Removal of CSPGs improves axonal regeneration and functional recovery. CSPGs may also be involved in the pathol. processes in diseases such as epilepsy, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Several possible methods of manipulating CSPGs in the CNS have recently been identified. The development of methods to remove CSPGs has considerable therapeutic potential in a no. of CNS disorders.

	Abstract = {In the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) peripheral sensory axons fail to regenerate past the peripheral nervous system/central nervous system (PNS/CNS) interface. Additionally, in the spinal cord, central fibers that regenerate into Schwann cell (SC) bridges can enter but do not exit at the distal Schwann cell/astrocyte (AC) boundary. At both interfaces where limited mixing of the two cell types occurs, one can observe an up-regulation of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We treated confrontation Schwann cell/astrocyte cultures with the following: (1) a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) enzyme against the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-chain-initiating enzyme, xylosyltransferase-1 (XT-1), (2) a control DNA enzyme, and (3) chondroitinase ABC (Ch'ase ABC) to degrade the GAG chains. Both techniques for reducing CSPGs allowed Schwann cells to penetrate deeply into the territory of the astrocytes. After adding sensory neurons to the assay, the axons showed different growth behaviors depending upon the glial cell type that they first encountered during regeneration. Our results help to explain why regeneration fails at PNS/CNS glial boundaries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Members of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family also play important roles in axon guidance and growth, RPTP beta and Eph receptors interact with cell-surface-bound ligands, and there is increasing evidence that both transmembrane ephrins and contactin, a ligand for RPTP beta, may possess an intrinsic signalling function. Thus, the cell-contact-dependent interactions between these receptors and ligands may lead to initiation of bidirectional signals that regulate axonal growth and migration.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitin Sulfate ABC Iyase I from Proteus vulgaris is an endolytic, broad-specificity glycosaminoglycan Iyase, which degrades chondroitin, chondroitin-4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and hyaluronan by beta-elimination of 1,4-hexosaminidic bond to unsaturated disaccharides and tetrasaccharides. Its structure revealed three domains. The N-terminal domain has a fold similar to that of carbohydrate-binding domains of xylanases and some lectins, the middle and C-terminal domains are similar to the structures of the two-domain chondroitin lyase AC and bacterial hyaluronidases. Although the middle domain shows a very low level of sequence identity with the catalytic domains of chondroitinase AC and hyaluronidase, the residues implicated in catalysis of the latter enzymes are present in chondroitinase ABC I. The substrate-binding site in chondroitinase ABC I is in a wide-open cleft, consistent with the endolytic action pattern of this enzyme. The tryptophan residues crucial for substrate binding in chondroitinase AC and hyaluronidases are lacking in chondroitinase ABC I. The structure of chondroitinase ABC I provides a framework for probing specific functions of active-site residues for understanding the remarkably broad specificity of this enzyme and perhaps engineering a desired specificity. The electron density map showed clearly that the deposited DNA sequence for residues 495-530 of chondroitin ABC lyase I, the segment containing two putative active-site residues, contains a frame-shift error resulting in an incorrectly translated amino acid sequence.

To obtain more information on the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans, we have selected a panel of anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibodies from a semisynthetic antibody phage display library by panning against glycosaminoglycan preparations derived from skeletal muscle. Epitope recognition by the antibodies is strongly dependent on O- and N-sulfation of the heparan sulfate. Immunostaining with these antibodies showed a distinct distribution of heparan sulfate epitopes in muscle basal lamina of various species. Clear differences in staining intensity were observed between neural, synaptic, and extrasynaptic basal laminae. Moreover, temporal and regional changes in abundancy of heparan sulfate epitopes were observed during muscle development both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest a role for specific heparan sulfate domains/species in myogenesis and synaptogenesis. Detailed analysis of the functions of heparan sulfate epitopes in muscle morphogenesis has now become feasible with the isolation of antibodies specific for distinct heparan sulfate epitopes.},

	Abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes postnatal maturation of GABAergic inhibition in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, and its expression and release are enhanced by neuronal activity, suggesting that it acts in a feedback manner to maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition during development. BDNF promotes differentiation of cerebellar, hippocampal, and neostriatal inhibitory neurons, but its effects on the dendritic development of neocortical inhibitory interneurons remain unknown. Here, we show that BDNF mediates depolarization-induced dendritic growth and branching in neocortical interneurons. To visualize inhibitory interneurons, we biolistically transfected organotypic cortical slice cultures from neonatal mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67 promoter. Nearly all GAD67-GFP-expressing neurons were nonpyramidal, many contained GABA, and some expressed markers of neurochemically defined GABAergic subtypes, indicating that GAD67-GFP-expressing neurons were GABAergic. We traced dendritic trees from confocal images of the same GAD67-GFP-expressing neurons before and after a 5 d growth period, and quantified the change in total dendritic length (TDL) and total dendritic branch points (TDBPs) for each neuron. GAD67-GFP-expressing neurons growing in control medium exhibited a 20% increase in TDL, but in 200 ng/ml BDNF or 10 mm KCl, this increase nearly doubled and was accompanied by a significant increase in TDBPs. Blocking action potentials with TTX did not prevent the BDNF-induced growth, but antibodies against BDNF blocked the growth-promoting effect of KCl. We conclude that BDNF, released by neocortical pyramidal neurons in response to depolarization, enhances dendritic growth and branching in nearby inhibitory interneurons.},

Avian IgY antibodies are produced in significantly higher yield than is possible for mouse or rabbit IgG, and exhibit reduced cross reactivity with native mammalian proteins. For a tri-LacNAc antigen, affinity purification against immobilized mono-LacNAc was necessary to provide a set of antibodies with specific binding properties. Comparable performance was observed for the virus-based polyclonal versus a commercial monoclonal antibody raised against the globo-H tetrasaccharide; this highlights the utility of the glycan microarray for both quality control and rapid in-depth analysis.

	Abstract = {The distribution of neurocan-like and 6B4 proteoglycan-like immunoreactivities in the rat embryo was investigated from gestational days 10.5-15.5 with monoclonal antibody 1G2 or 6B4 that immunoreacted with neurocan and 6B4 proteoglycan, respectively. In the brain region, the leptomeningeal layer in the myelencephalon, metencephalon, diencephalon or telencephalon was first stained with monoclonal antibody 1G2 at embryonic day 12.5. In the spinal cord, monoclonal antibody 1G2 stained the regions corresponding to the boundary caps (designated the boundary caps) after embryonic day 11.5 and the roof plate after embryonic day 12.5. The intensity of staining in the boundary caps reached a maximum at embryonic day 13.5, at around the time when the axons from the dorsal root ganglia reach this region. However, the points of contact of the axons with the boundary caps were hardly stained. By contrast, the roof plate was most strongly and widely stained at embryonic day 14.5, at around the time when the axons enter the spinal cord. Western blotting of preparations from the spinal cord that included the boundary caps revealed the presence of neurocan in this region. Thus, it is likely that neurocan serves as a barrier molecule to regulate the direction of axonal growth from the dorsal root ganglia. By contrast, in addition to staining of the future brain and spinal cord, monoclonal antibody 6B4 stained the trigeminal and sympathetic ganglia in the rat embryo on and after embryonic day 12.5, as well as the vestibular, facial and dorsal root ganglia after embryonic day 12.5. In studies in tissue culture, monoclonal antibody 6B4 prevented the inhibitory effects of 6B4 proteoglycan on the proliferation of PC12D cells. No immunostaining with monoclonal antibody 6B4 was observed in cells that had incorporated bromodeoxyuridine in vivo. Possible functions of 6B4 proteoglycan in the rat embryo are discussed.

M., Morris, H.R., and Dell, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26745-26754).

The tetrasaccharide fraction was subfractionated by high performance liquid chromatography on an amine-bound silica column. Systematic structural analysis of five major fractions, h, l, m, n, and q, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, enzymatic digestions in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis, and 500-MHz H-1 NMR spectroscopy revealed one disulfated, three trisulfated, and one diasulfated tetrasaccharide structure: fraction h, GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S)beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S); fraction l, GlcA(3S)beta 1-3GalNAc(6S)beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S) fraction m, GlcA(3S)beta 1-3GalNAc(4S)beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S); fraction n, GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S.6S)beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GaINAc(4S); and fraction q, GlcA(3S)beta 1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc(4S), where 3S, 4S, and 6S represent 3-O-, 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively.

In the present study we examined how motor skill learning affects the dendritic morphology of the stellate local circuit neurons. Adult female rats were either trained to complete a complex motor learning task or forced to traverse a flat, obstacle-free runway. Golgi impregnated stellate cells were then traced via camera lucida and their dendritic arborizations examined with a concentric ring analysis. Results showed the motor learning animals to have significantly greater stellate cell dendritic arborizations than the activity controls. Thus these local circuit neurons exhibit morphological plasticity. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports dissocn. consts. and \"effective molarities\" (Meff) for the intramol. binding of a ligand covalently attached to the surface of a protein by oligo(ethylene glycol) (EGn) linkers of different lengths (n = 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20) and compares these exptl. values with theor. ests. from polymer theory. As expected, the value of Meff is lowest when the linker is too short (n = 0) to allow the ligand to bind noncovalently at the active site of the protein without strain, is highest when the linker is the optimal length (n = 2) to allow such binding to occur, and decreases monotonically as the length increases past this optimal value (but only by a factor of .apprx.8 from n = 2 to n = 20). These exptl. results are not compatible with a model in which the single bonds of the linker are completely restricted when the ligand has bound noncovalently to the active site of the protein, but they are quant. compatible with a model that treats the linker as a random-coil polymer. Calorimetry revealed that enthalpic interactions between the linker and the protein are not important in detg. the thermodn. of the system. Taken together, these results suggest that the manifestation of the linker in the thermodn. of binding is exclusively entropic. The values of Meff are, theor., intrinsic properties of the EGn linkers and can be used to predict the avidities of multivalent ligands with these linkers for multivalent proteins. The weak dependence of Meff on linker length suggests that multivalent ligands contg. flexible linkers that are longer than the spacing between the binding sites of a multivalent protein will be effective in binding, and that the use of flexible linkers with lengths somewhat greater than the optimal distance between binding sites is a justifiable strategy for the design of multivalent ligands.

We report that the related neurotrophins NGF and NT-3, acting through a common receptor, TrkA, are required for sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth and, thus, innervation of target fields. Yet, while NGF supports TrkA internalization and retrograde signaling from distal axons to cell bodies to promote neuronal survival, NT-3 cannot. Interestingly, final target-derived NGF promotes expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, in turn causing a reduction in the sensitivity of axons to intermediate target-derived NT-3. We propose that a hierarchical neurotrophin signaling cascade coordinates sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth, innervation of targets, and survival in a manner dependent on the differential control of TrkA internalization, trafficking, and retrograde axonal signaling.},

	Abstract = {Cathepsin K is the major collagenolytic enzyme produced by bone-resorbing osteoclasts. We showed earlier that the unique triple-helical collagen-degrading activity of cathepsin K depends on the formation of complexes with bone-or cartilage-resident glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S). Here, we describe the crystal structure of a 1:n complex of cathepsin K:C4-S inhibited by E64 at a resolution of 1.8 angstrom. The overall structure reveals an unusual "beads-on-a-string"-like organization. Multiple cathepsin K molecules bind specifically to a single cosine curve-shaped strand of C4-S with each cathepsin K molecule interacting with three disaccharicle residues of C4-S. One of the more important sets of interactions comes from a single turn of helix close to the N terminus of the proteinase containing a basic amino acid triplet (Arg8-Lys9-Lys10) that forms multiple hydrogen bonds either to the caboxylate or to the 4-sulfate groups of C4-S. Altogether, the binding sites with C4-S are located in the R-domain of cathepsin K and are distant from its active site. This explains why the general proteolytic activity of cathepsin K is not affected by the binding of chondroitin sulfate. Biochemical analyses of cathepsin K and C4-S mixtures support the presence of a 1:n complex in solution; a dissociation constant, K-d, of about 10 nM was determined for the interaction between cathepsin K and C4-S.

	Abstract = {Reverse signaling by ephrin-As upon binding EphAs controls axon guidance and mapping. Ephrin-As are GPI-anchored to the membrane, requiring that they complex with transmembrane proteins that transduce their signals. We show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) serves this role in retinal axons. p75(NTR) and ephrin-A colocalize within caveolae along retinal axons and form a complex required for Fyn phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal changes. In vitro, retinal axon repulsion to EphAs by ephrin-A reverse signaling requires p75(NTR), but repulsion to ephrin-As by EphA forward signaling does not. Constitutive and retina-specific p75(NTR) knockout mice have aberrant anterior shifts in retinal axon terminations in superior colliculus, consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded ephrin-A reverse signaling induced by graded collicular EphAs. We conclude that p75(NTR) is a signaling partner for ephrin-As and the ephrin-A-p75(NTR) complex reverse signals to mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping.},

	Abstract = {Synapse formation requires contact between dendrites and axons. Although this process is often viewed as axon mediated, dendritic filopodia may be actively involved in mediating synaptogenic contact. Although the signaling cues underlying dendritic filopodial motility are mostly unknown, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increases the density of dendritic filopodia and conditional deletion of tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) reduces synapse number in vivo. Here, we report that TrkB associates with dendritic growth cones and filopodia, mediates filopodial motility, and does so via the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We used genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mouse hippocampal neurons to assess signaling downstream of TrkB. Conditional knock-out of two downstream negative regulators of TrkB signaling, Pten (phosphatase with tensin homolog) and Nf1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), enhanced filopodial motility. This effect was PI3K-dependent and correlated with synaptic density. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) was preferentially localized in filopodia and this distribution was enhanced by BDNF application. Thus, intracellular control of filopodial dynamics converged on PI3K activation and PIP3 accumulation, a cellular paradigm conserved for chemotaxis in other cell types. Our results suggest that filopodial movement is not random, but responsive to synaptic guidance molecules.},

The primary sequence of ArthroAC has not been previously determined but it was possible to determine the amino acid sequence of this enzyme from the high-resolution electron density maps and to confirm it by mass spectrometry. The enzyme -substrate complexes were obtained by soaking the substrate into the crystals for varying lengths of time (30 seconds to ten hours) and flash-cooling the crystals. The electron density map for crystals soaked in the substrate for as short as 30 seconds showed the substrate clearly and indicated that the ring of central glucuronic acid assumes a distorted boat conformation. This structure strongly supports the lytic mechanism where Tyr242 acts as a general base that abstracts the proton from the C5 position of glucuronic acid while Asn183 and His233 neutralize the charge on the glucuronate acidic group. Comparison of this structure with that of chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum (FlavoAC) provides an explanation for the exolytic and endolytic mode of action of ArthroAC and FlavoAC, respectively.

	Abstract = {A review with 378 refs. Polyvalent interactions are characterized by the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biol. entity (a mol., a surface) to multiple receptors on another. These interactions occur throughout biol., and have a no. of characteristics that monovalent interactions do not. In particular, polyvalent interactions can be collectively much stronger than corresponding monovalent interactions, and they can provide the basis for mechanisms of both agonizing and antagonizing biol. interactions that are fundamentally different from those available in monovalent systems. The first part of this review examines the theor. framework for polyvalency, describes a consistent nomenclature for polyvalent interactions, and discusses the central role of entropy in polyvalency. This examn. is qual., and selectively highlights the most important characteristics of polyvalency. The second part surveys a no. of biol. processes that involve polyvalent interactions, with detailed discussion of examples that help to illustrate that many settings for polyvalent systems. This systematic survey suggests new targets and new strategies for the design of pharmaceutical agents based on polyvalency. The third part discusses principles of design, synthesis, and assay of synthetic polyvalent ligands, using the attachment of the influenza virus to an erythrocyte as a prototypical polyvalent system. This discussion of the activities of polyvalent, polymeric inhibitors of the hemagglutination induced by this virus indicates that there are multiple modes of interaction in this representative and particularly well studied polyvalent interaction; the two most important are entropically enhanced binding and steric stabilization.

In the present study, the effect of degrading CSPGs with the application of the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (chABC) into the cuneate nucleus of rats partially denervated of forepaw dorsal column axons was examined. A dorsal column transection between the C6-C7 dorsal root entry zones was followed immediately by an ipsilateral brainstem injection of either chABC or a bacterial-derived control enzyme [ penicillinase (P-ase)] and then subsequently ( 1 week later) followed with a second brainstem enzyme injection and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) tracer injection into the ipsilateral forepaw digits and pads. After 1 additional week, the rats underwent electrophysiological receptive field mapping of the cuneate nucleus and/or anatomical evaluation. Examination of the brainstems of rats from each group revealed that CSPGs had been reduced after chABC treatment. Importantly, in the chABC- treated rats ( but not in the P-ase controls), a significantly greater area of the cuneate nucleus was occupied by physiologically active CTB traced forepaw afferents that had been spared by the initial cord lesion. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a functional change directly linked to anatomical evidence of sprouting by spinal cord afferents after chABC treatment.},

To address the role of retinal waves in topographic map development, we examined wave dynamics and retinocollicular projections in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. beta2(-/-) mice lack waves during the first postnatal week, but RGCs have high levels of uncorrelated firing. By P8, the wild-type retinocollicular projection remodels into a refined map characterized by axons of neighboring RGCs forming focal termination zones (TZs) of overlapping arbors. In contrast, in P8 beta2(-/-) mice, neighboring RGC axons form large TZs characterized by broadly distributed arbors. At P8, glutamatergic retinal waves appear in beta2(-/-) mice, and later, visually patterned activity appears, but the diffuse TZs fail to remodel. Thus, spontaneous retinal waves that correlate RGC activity are required for retinotopic map remodeling during a brief early critical period.},

	Abstract = {Genetic studies have shown that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions through incompletely understood mechanisms. We report here that ephrin-B1 stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T colorectal epithelial cells inhibited integrin-mediated adhesion and HGF/SF-induced directional cell migration. Using 293 cells stably transfected with wild type (WT)- or kinase-deficient (KD-EphB3), we found that inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and induction of cell rounding was kinase-dependent. Unexpectedly, in two independent assays, both KD- and WT-EphB3 significantly inhibited directional cell migration. Upon ephrin-B1 stimulation, the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 were reduced in both WT- and KD- EphB3-expressing cells that were induced to migrate. Pharmacological evidence demonstrates that a relative increase in RhoA signaling as a result of decreased Rac1/ Cdc42 activities contributes to the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, EphB3-mediated inhibitory effect on cell adhesion but not migration was abolished by the integrin activating antibodies, suggesting that the inhibition of cell migration is not because of down-regulation of integrin function. These results uncover a differential requirement for EphB3 catalytic activity in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, and suggest that while catalytic activity of EphB3 is required for inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, a distinct signaling pathway to Rho GTPases shared by WT- and KD- EphB3 receptor mediates inhibition of directional cell migration.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitinase B from Pedobacter heparinus is the only known enzyme strictly specific for dermatan sulfate and is a widely used enzymatic tool for the structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans. This beta-helical polysaccharide lyase belongs to family PL-6 and cleaves the beta(1,4) linkage of dermatan sulfate in a random manner, yielding 4,5-unsaturated dermatan sulfate disaccharides as the product. The previously reported structure of its complex with a dermatan sulfate disaccharide product identified the -1 and -2 subsites of the catalytic groove. We present here the structure of chondroitinase B complexed with several dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides. In particular, the soaking of chondroitinase B crystals with a dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide results in a complex with two dermatan sulfate disaccharide reaction products, enabling the identification of the +2 and +1 subsites. Unexpectedly, this structure revealed the presence of a calcium ion coordinated by sequence-conserved acidic residues and by the carboxyl group of the L-iduronic acid at the +1 subsite. Kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have subsequently demonstrated that chondroitinase B absolutely requires calcium for its activity, indicating that the protein-Ca2+-oligosaccharide complex is functionally relevant. Modeling of an intact tetrasaccharide in the active site of chondroitinase B provided a better understanding of substrate specificity and the role of Ca2+ in enzymatic activity. Given these results, we propose that the Ca2+ ion neutralizes the carboxyl moiety of the L-iduronic acid at the cleavage site, whereas the conserved residues Lys-250 and Arg-271 act as Bronsted base and acid, respectively, in the lytic degradation of dermatan sulfate by chondroitinase B.},

	Abstract = {A review. Heparan sulfate (HS) is an essential and dynamic regulator of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Two fundamentally different crystallog. models have been proposed to explain, at the mol. level, how HS/heparin enables FGF and FGF receptor (FGFR) to assemble into a functional dimer on the cell surface. In the sym. two-end' model, the heparin-binding sites of FGF and FGFR merge to form a basic canyon that recruits two HS for binding. Within this canyon, the HS mols. primarily act to orchestrate and fortify multivalent and cooperative protein-protein contacts within the dimer that are the foundations of dimerization. In contrast, in the asym. model, which mechanistically resembles the previously proposed trans FGF dimer model, a single heparin mol. facilitates dimerization by crosslinking two FGFs into a trans dimer that brings together the two FGFRs. Interestingly, the crystal structure upon which the asym. model is based contains a sym. dimer reminiscent of the sym. two-end model, suggesting that a different interpretation of the crystal structure has led to the postulation of the asym. model. Importantly, the sym. two-end model provides an intriguing soln. to the problem of how HS selectivity is achieved in FGF signaling. The model reveals that, within the canyon, FGF and FGFR no longer adhere to their individual HS binding specificities, but instead act in unison to search for a unique HS motif from a plethora of HS epitopes that are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Primary sequence differences within the heparin-binding sites of FGFs and FGFRs, together with ligand-induced changes in FGFR conformation, lead to the formation of distinct canyons with unique HS specificity for individual FGF-FGFR complexes.

Spectroscopic investigation of Ni(CO)(3)PR(3) complexes of the new phosphines indicated that phosphines bearing quaternary amine functionalities were less electron donating than tricyclohexylphosphine, while the presence of a sulfonate group increased phosphine electron donation.

	Abstract = {Interaction of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) with heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) is required for receptor activation and initiation of biological responses. To gain insight into the mechanism of activation of the FGF receptor by FGF-2 and heparin, we have used NMR, dynamic light scattering, and HSPG-deficient cells and cell-free systems. The first 28 N-terminal residues in FGF-2 were found to be highly mobile and flexible, consistent with the disorder found in both the NMR and X-ray structures. The structure of an FGF-2-heparin-decasaccharide complex that binds to and activates the FGF receptor was compared to a heparin-tetrasaccharide-induced complex that does not promote an interaction with the receptor. The major change observed upon the addition of the tetrasaccharide to FGF-2 was an increase in the correlation time consistent with the formation of an FGF-2 dimer. The NMR line widths of FGF-2 in the presence of the decasaccharide are severely broadened relative to the tetrasaccharide, consistent with dynamic light scattering results which indicate FGF-2 is a tetramer. The interaction of these heparin species with FGF-2 does not induce a significant conformational change in the overall structure of FGF-2, but small chemical shift changes are observed in both heparin and receptor binding sites. A trans-oriented symmetric dimer of FGF-2 is formed in the presence of the tetrasaccharide whereas two cis-oriented dimers in a symmetric tetramer are formed in the presence of the decasaccharide. This suggests that the cis-oriented FGF-2 dimer is the minimal biologically active structural unit of FGF-2. These data allow us to propose a novel mechanism to explain the functional interaction of FGF-2 with heparin and its transmembrane receptor.},

The synthetic strategy is based on the polymerization of norbornene and its derivatives affording di- and triblock side chains bearing sugars (mannose, galactose, glucose etc.), linked via O- (ester), and glycosidase resistant C- (isoxazoline) glycosides. The efficient placement of norbornene units on the side chain termini and their conversion into PMMs, facilitated by the Mo alkylidenes, proceeded in a living manner with the quantitative initiation. The methodology was applied to prepare poly(macromonomer)-graft-PEG [PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)], by the attachment of a pseudo phenol terminus on the PMM main chain to PEG-Ms(2) [MsO(CH(2)CH(2)O)(n)Ms, Ms=MeSO(2)] using a "grafting to" approach. Removal of the acetal protecting groups from the sugar coating of a variety of supramolecular structures including PMMs, linear amphiphilic block copolymers (ABC) and a PMM-graft-PEGby using trifluroacetic acid/water (9:1), and suspension in water, prompted the spontaneous formation of spherical architectures by self-assembly of the amphiphilic PMMs as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ability to uptake the hydrophobic dye (Nile Red) into the micellar cores of a variety of amphiphilic polymeric fragments is a significant step towards the production of sugar-coated nanospheres for cell-targeting biomimetic applications.},

	Abstract = {Fucose-alpha(1-2)-galactose (Fucalpha(1-2)Gal) sugars have been implicated in the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal development, learning and memory. However, an understanding of their precise roles has been hampered by a lack of information regarding Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins. Here, we report the first proteomic studies of this plasticity-relevant epitope. We identify five classes of potential Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins: cell adhesion molecules, ion channels and solute carriers/transporters, ATP-binding proteins, synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, and mitochondrial proteins. In addition, we show that Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins are enriched in the developing mouse olfactory bulb (OB) and exhibit a distinct spatiotemporal expression that is consistent with the presence of a "glycocode" to help direct olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axonal pathfinding. We find that expression of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal sugars in the OB is regulated by the alpha(1-2)fucosyltransferase FUT1. FUT1-deficient mice exhibit developmental defects including fewer and smaller glomeruli and a thinner olfactory nerve layer, suggesting that fucosylation contributes to OB development. Our findings significantly expand the number of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which fucosyl sugars contribute to neuronal processes.alphaalpha.},

	Abstract = {Nogo-A is a potent neurite growth inhibitor in vitro and plays a role both in the restriction of axonal regeneration after injury and in structural plasticity in the CNS of higher vertebrates. The regions that mediate inhibition and the topology of the molecule in the plasma membrane have to be defined. Here we demonstrate the presence of three different active sites: (1) an N-terminal region involved in the inhibition of fibroblast spreading, (2) a stretch encoded by the Nogo-A-specific exon that restricts neurite outgrowth and cell spreading and induces growth cone collapse, and (3) a C-terminal region (Nogo-66) with growth cone collapsing function. We show that Nogo-A-specific active fragments bind to the cell surface of responsive cells and to rat brain cortical membranes, suggesting the existence of specific binding partners or receptors. Several antibodies against different epitopes on the Nogo-A-specific part of the protein as well as antisera against the 66 aa loop in the C-terminus stain the cell surface of living cultured oligodendrocytes. Nogo-A is also labeled by nonmembrane-permeable biotin derivatives applied to living oligodendrocyte cultures. Immunofluorescent staining of intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum-associated Nogo-A in cells after selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane reveals that the epitopes of Nogo-A, shown to be accessible at the cell surface, are exposed to the cytoplasm. This suggests that Nogo-A could have a second membrane topology. The two proposed topological variants may have different intracellular as well as extracellular functions.},

The first four generations of this novel class of monodispersed neoglycoconjugates having up to 32 mannoside units were evaluated as ligands for the phytohemagglutinins from concanavalin A (Con A) and Pisum sativum (pea lectin) using enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) and turbidimetric analyses. The binding properties of these glycodendrimers, together with reference monosaccharides, were determined using yeast mannan as a coating antigen and peroxidase-labeled lectins. These mannosylated dendrimers were demonstrated to be potent inhibitors with IC50 values 400 times better than those of monomeric methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside taken as a standard. Their lipophilic character was shown to be sufficient for their direct use as coating antigens in microtiter plate assays. Moreover, their ability to bind and form insoluble carbohydrate-lectin complexes was also demonstrated by radial double immunodiffusion and turbidimetric analyses. Furthermore, the ability of these ligands to selectively precipitate a mannose-binding protein (Con A) from a crude lectin mixture was also demonstrated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

	Abstract = {Depending o the stimuli they encounter, B lymphocytes engage in signaling events that lead to immunity or tolerance. Both responses are mediated through antigen interactions with the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Antigen valency is thought to be an important parameter in B cell signaling, but systematic studies are lacking. To explore this issue, we synthesized multi-valent ligands of defined valencies using the ring-opening metathesis polymn. (ROMP). When mice are injected with multi-valent antigens generated by ROMP, only those of high valencies elicit antibody prodn. These results indicate that ligands synthesized by ROMP can activate immune responses in vivo. All of the multi-valent antigens tested activate signaling through the BCR. The ability of antigens to cluster the BCR, promote its localization to membrane microdomains, and augment intracellular Ca2+ concn. increases as a function of antigen valency. In contrast, no difference in BCR internalization were detected. Our results indicate that differences in the antigenicity of BCR ligands are related to their ability to elicit increases in intracellular Ca2+ concn. Finally, we obsd. that unligated BCRs cluster with BCRs engaged by multi-valent ligands, a result that suggests that signals mediated by the BCR are amplified through receptor arrays. Our data suggest a link between the mechanisms underlying signal initiation by receptors that must respond with high sensitivity. [on SciFinder (R)]},

	Abstract = {Soluble factors from serum such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are thought to activate the small GTP-binding protein Rho based on their ability to induce actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho-dependent manner. Cell adhesion to extracellular matrices (ECM) has also been proposed to activate Rho, but this point has been controversial due to the difficulty of distinguishing changes in Rho activity from the structural contributions of ECM to the formation of focal adhesions. To address these questions, we established an assay for GTP-bound cellular Rho, Plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicited a transient inhibition of Rho, followed by a phase of Rho activation. The activation phase was greatly enhanced by serum. In serum-starved adherent cells, LPA induced transient Rho activation, whereas in suspended cells Rho activation was sustained. Furthermore, suspended cells showed higher Rho activity than adherent cells in the presence of serum. These data indicate the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative-feedback loop, We also observed that both cytochalasin D and colchicine trigger Rho activation despite their opposite effects on stress fibers and focal adhesions. Our results show that ECM, cytoskeletal structures and soluble factors all contribute to regulation of Rho activity.},

	Abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase is a surface enzyme of this Gram- positive bacterium. The enzyme degrades hyaluronan and chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfates by cleaving the beta1,4- glycosidic linkage between the glycan units of these polymeric substrates. This degradation helps spreading of this bacterial organism throughout the host tissues and facilitates the disease process caused by pneumococci. The mechanism of this degradative process is based on beta- elimination, is termed proton acceptance and donation, and involves selected residues of a well defined catalytic site of the enzyme. The degradation of hyaluronan alone is thought to proceed through a processive mode of action. The structures of complexes between the enzyme and chondroitin as well as chondroitin sulfate disaccharides allowed for the first detailed insights into these interactions and the mechanism of action on chondroitins. This degradation of chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfates is nonprocessive and is selective for the chondroitin sulfates only with certain sulfation patterns. Chondroitin sulfation at the 4- position on the nonreducing site of the linkage to be cleaved or 2- sulfation prevent degradation due to steric clashes with the enzyme. Evolutionary studies suggest that hyaluronate lyases evolved from chondroitin lyases and still retained chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfate degradation abilities while being specialized in the degradation of hyaluronan. The more efficient processive degradation mechanism has come to be preferred for the unsulfated substrate hyaluronan.},

	Abstract = {Dendritic arborization is required for proper neuronal connectivity. Rho GTPases have been implicated in the regulation of dendrite development. However, the signaling pathways that impinge on these molecular switches remain poorly understood. Here we show that Wnt7b, which is expressed in the mouse hippocampus, increases dendritic branching in cultured hippocampal neurons. This effect is mimicked by the expression of Dishevelled (Dvl) and is blocked by Sfrp1, a secreted Wnt antagonist. Consistent with these findings, hippocampal neurons from mice lacking Dvl1 show reduced dendritic arborization. Activation of the canonical Wnt-Gsk3beta pathway does not affect dendritic development. In contrast, Wnt7b and Dvl activate Rac and JNK in hippocampal neurons. Dominant-negative Rac, dominant-negative JNK or inhibition of JNK blocks Dvl-mediated dendritic growth. These findings demonstrate a new function for the non-canonical Wnt pathway in dendrite development and identify Dvl as a regulator of Rho GTPases and JNK during dendritic morphogenesis.},

	Abstract = {The formation of dendritic spines during development and their structural plasticity in the adult brain are critical aspects of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Many different factors and proteins have been shown to control dendritic spine development and remodeling (Ethell and Pasquale, 2005). The extracellular matrix (ECM) components and their cell surface receptors, integrins, have been found in the vicinity of synapses and shown to regulate synaptic efficacy and play an important role in long-term potentiation (Bahr et al., 1997; Chavis and Westbrook, 2001; Chan et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003; Bernard-Trifilo et al., 2005). Although molecular mechanisms by which integrins affect synaptic efficacy have begun to emerge, their role in structural plasticity is poorly understood. Here, we show that integrins are involved in spine remodeling in cultured hippocampal neurons. The treatment of 14 d in vitro hippocampal neurons with arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-containing peptide, an established integrin ligand, induced elongation of existing dendritic spines and promoted formation of new filopodia. These effects were also accompanied by integrin-dependent actin reorganization and synapse remodeling, which were partially inhibited by function-blocking antibodies against beta1 and beta3 integrins. This actin reorganization was blocked with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate]. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN93 (N-[2-[N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylaminomethyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-meth oxybenzenesulfonamide) also suppressed RGD-induced actin reorganization and synapse remodeling. Our findings show that integrins control ECM-mediated spine remodeling in hippocampal neurons through NMDAR/CaMKII-dependent actin reorganization.},

To quantify CS content in raw materials and in an ophthalmic solution, each test sample and the authentic CS were first digested by chondroitinase ABC. The CS disaccharides produced were analyzed by strong anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC) and CS content was quantified by calculating the total peak areas of the disaccharides derived from a CS calibration curve. In the case of soft capsules, CS was first extracted with hexane followed by phenol-chloroform to remove oil and protein ingredients. The extracted CS samples were depolymerized by chondroitinase ABC and CS content was determined. Quantitative analysis of the disaccharides derived from raw materials and an ophthalmic solution showed the CS contents (%) were 39.5+/-0.1 to 105.6+/-0.1 and 103.3+/-1.2, respectively.

Here we describe the structure of the CSA binding DBL3x domain, a Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain of VAR2CSA. By forming a complex of DBL3x with CSA oligosaccharides and determining its structure, we have identified the CSA binding site to be a cluster of conserved positively charged residues on subdomain 2 and subdomain 3. Mutation or chemical modification of lysine residues at the site markedly diminished CSA binding to DBL3x. The location of the CSA binding site is an important step forward in the molecular understanding of pregnancy-associated malaria and offers a new target for vaccine development.},

	Abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is considered to underlie learning and memory and is associated with the enlargement of dendritic spines. Because the consolidation of memory and LTP require protein synthesis, it is important to clarify how protein synthesis affects spine enlargement. In rat brain slices, the repetitive pairing of postsynaptic spikes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate at single spines (a spike-timing protocol) produced both immediate and gradual phases of spine enlargement in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The gradual enlargement was strongly dependent on protein synthesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) action, often associated with spine twitching, and was induced specifically at the spines that were immediately enlarged by the synaptic stimulation. Thus, this spike-timing protocol is an efficient trigger for BDNF secretion and induces protein synthesis-dependent long-term enlargement at the level of single spines.},

	Abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans, linear carbohydrates such as heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, participate in a variety of biological processes including cell-matrix interactions and activation of chemokines, enzymes and growth factors. This review will discuss progress in immunology and the science of wound repair that has revealed the importance of glycosaminoglycans, and their proteoglycans, in the inflammatory process. Heparan sulfate enables growth factor function and modifies enzyme/inhibitor functions, such as antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II. Heparan sulfate also interacts with cytokines/chemokines and participates in leukocyte selectin binding to promote the recruitment of leukocytes. Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate regulates growth factor activity and is an alternate modulator of heparin cofactor II. In addition, dermatan sulfate induces ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and also recruits leukocytes via selectin interactions. Hyaluronan alternatively participates in leukocyte recruitment via interaction with CD44, while activating various inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, through CD44-dependent signaling. Hyaluronan also signals through Toll-like receptor 4 to induce dendritic cell maturation and promote cytokine release by dendritic cells and endothelial cells. Taken together, the field of glycosaminoglycan biology provides new clues and explanations of the process of inflammation and suggests new therapeutic approaches to human disease.

Here we report that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is a co-receptor of NgR for MAG signaling. In cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing NgR, p75(NTR) was required for MAG-induced intracellular Ca2+ elevation. Co-immunoprecipitation showed an association of NgR with p75(NTR) that can be disrupted by an antibody against p75(NTR) (NGFR5), and extensive coexpression was observed in the developing rat nervous system. Furthermore, NGFR5 abolished MAG-induced repulsive turning of Xenopus axonal growth cones and Ca2+ elevation, both in neurons and in NgR/p75(NTR)-expressing HEK cells. Thus we conclude that p75(NTR) is a co-receptor of NgR for MAG signaling and a potential therapeutic target for promoting nerve regeneration.},

	Abstract = {Memory storage in mammalian neurons probably depends on both biochemical events and morphological alterations in dendrites. Here we report an activity-dependent stabilization of the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway, prominent in hippocampal dendrites. The longevity of the signal in these dendrites was increased to hours when multiple spaced stimuli were used. Likewise, spaced stimuli and MAPK activation were critical for protrusion of new dendritic filopodia that also remained stable for hours. Our experiments define a new role for stimulus-specific responses of MAPK signaling in activity-dependent neuronal plasticity. The local biochemical signaling in dendrites complements MAPK signaling in gene expression. Together, these processes may support long-lasting behavioral changes.},

	Abstract = {Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sulfated glycans inhibit formation of the abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in prion-infected cells and prolong the incubation time of scrapie-infected animals. Sulfation of GAGs is not tightly regulated and possible sites of sulfation are randomly modified, which complicates elucidation of the fundamental structures of GAGs that mediate the inhibition of PrPSc formation. To address the structure-activity relationship of GAGs in the inhibition of PrPSc formation, we screened the ability of various regioselectively O-sulfated glycopyranosides to inhibit PrPSc formation in prion-infected cells. Among the glycopyranosides and their polymers examd., monomeric 4-sulfo-N-acetyl-glucosamine (4SGN), and two glycopolymers, poly-4SGN and poly-6-sulfo-N-acetyl-glucosamine (poly-6SGN), inhibited PrPSc formation with 50% EDs below 20 mg/mL, and their inhibitory effect became more evident with consecutive treatments. Structural comparisons suggested that a combination of an N-acetyl group at C-2 and an O-sulfate group at either O-4 or O-6 on glucopyranoside might be involved in the inhibition of PrPSc formation. Furthermore, polymeric but not monomeric 6SGN inhibited PrPSc formation, suggesting the importance of a polyvalent configuration in its effect. These results indicate that the synthetic sulfated glycosides are useful not only for the anal. of structure-activity relationship of GAGs but also for the development of therapeutics for prion diseases.

	Abstract = {Regulated growth and arborization of dendritic processes are critical to the formation of functional neuronal networks. Here we identify beta-catenin as a critical mediator of dendritic morphogenesis. We found that increasing the intracellular levels of beta-catenin and other members of the cadherin/catenin complex, namely N-cadherin and alphaN-catenin, enhances dendritic arborization in rat hippocampal neurons, an effect that does not require Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Conversely, proteins that sequester beta-catenin decreased dendritic branch tip number and total dendritic branch length. Enhancement of dendritic growth elicited by depolarization requires beta-catenin and increased Wnt release. These results identify Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as an important mediator of dendritic development and suggest that the intracellular level of the cadherin/catenin complex is a limiting factor during critical stages of dendritic morphogenesis.},

The mutant protein is presumed to acquire a toxic gain of function that is detrimental to striatal neurons in the brain. However, Loss of a beneficial activity of wild-type huntingtin may also cause the death of striatal neurons. Here we demonstrate that wild-type huntingtin up-regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain. We show that this beneficial activity of huntingtin is Lost when the protein becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This Leads to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then die. Restoring wild-type huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches for treating HD.},
