	Abstract = {Certain types of glial structures, located at strategic positions along axon pathways, may provide the mechanical and/or chemical elements for the construction of barriers which can grossly direct the elongation of axons during development. The roof plate, a putative axon barrier, is located along the dorsal midline of the developing spinal cord and may be important for the guidance of the commissural and dorsal column axons. We examined the roof plate to determine the developmental morphology of the region and to determine which molecules were correlated with the barrier function when axons were growing nearby. Light and electron microscopic observations of the roof plate revealed that this glial domain undergoes a dramatic change in shape from a ``wedge'' with large extracellular spaces between the cell apices at E12.5 to a thin, dense septum with reduced extracellular space at E15.5. Immunocytochemical techniques demonstrated that highly sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), the carbohydrate recognized by L2 monoclonal antibody, cholinesterase, stage-specific embryonic antigen 1, and a ligand that binds tetragonolobus purpureas agglutinin are expressed by the roof plate. These molecules, however, were also found in other regions of the spinal cord which are permissive or attractive to axon growth. A molecule which is unique to the roof plate when axons grow close to, but do not cross, the dorsal midline is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate is also present in the tectal midline and in other noninnervated regions such as the outer epidermis and developing cartilage. Our data suggest that keratan sulfate, alone or in combination with other molecules expressed by the roof plate, may be responsible, in part, for the inhibition of axon elongation through the roof plate in the embryonic spinal cord.},

@article{snow90,
	Abstract = { vivo studies of the roof plate of the spinal cord and midline optic tectum in rodent and the developing subplate in the telencephalon of the chick showed that two glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, possibly in the proteoglycan form (KS-PG, CS-PG, or KS/CS-PG), were present at times when axons approach closely but do not invade these territories. To address the question of whether KS/CS-PG actively inhibits growth cone elongation and to determine which component(s) of the proteoglycan may be critical to this phenomenon, we used a technique employing nitrocellulose-coated petri dishes onto which stripes of various purified macromolecules were attached. Isolated E9 chick dorsal root ganglia were grown on lanes of KS/CS-PG in alternation with lanes of the growth-promoting molecule laminin (LN). Neurite outgrowth was abundant along stripes of LN. In contrast, upon encountering a stripe containing KS/CS-PG, neurites either stopped abruptly or turned and traveled along the KS/CS-PG stripe border. The effect was dependent upon the concentration of the proteoglycan with intermediate concentrations producing intermittent patterns of crossing. We mixed LN with the KS/CS-PG, where the LN was in concentrations which alone support outgrowth, and observed that the KS/CS-PG was still inhibitory when such a growth-promoting molecule was present. A 10-fold higher concentration of LN was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of the KS/CS-PG. These results suggest that the interaction of inhibitory and growth-promoting molecules can interact to produce a wide spectrum of neurite patterns ranging from complete inhibition to totally unimpeded outgrowth. Selective enzymatic removal of the KS or CS from the KS/CS-PG permitted various degrees of neurite outgrowth to occur across the previously inhibitory lanes, and digestion of both glycosaminoglycan moieties, leaving only the protein core of the molecule, resulted in a complete lack of inhibition. These assays demonstrated that KS/CS-PG is inhibitory to embryonic dorsal root ganglia neurites in vitro and that complete inhibition requires contributions from both KS and CS moieties.},

	Abstract = {Axon outgrowth between the spinal cord and the hindlimb of the chick embryo is constrained by three tissues that border axon pathways. Growth cones turn to avoid the posterior sclerotome, perinotochordal mesenchyme, and pelvic girdle precursor during normal development and after experimental manipulation. We wanted to know if these functionally similar barriers to axon advance also share a common molecular composition. Since the posterior sclerotome differentially binds peanut agglutinin (PNA) and since PNA binding is also typical of prechondrogenic differentiation, we examined the pattern of expression of PNA binding sites and cartilage proteoglycan epitopes in relation to axon outgrowth. We found that all three barrier tissues preferentially express both PNA binding sites and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C-6-S) immunoreactivity at the time when growth cones avoid these tissues. Moreover, both epitopes are expressed in the roof plate of the spinal cord and in the early limb bud, two additional putative barriers to axon advance. In contrast, neither epitope is detected in peripheral axon pathways. In the somites, this dichotomous pattern of expression clearly preceded the invasion of the anterior sclerotome by either motor growth cones or neural crest cells. However, in the limb, barrier markers disappeared from presumptive axon pathways in concert with the invasion of axons. Since this coordinate pattern suggested that the absence of barrier markers in these axon pathways requires an interaction with growth cones, we analyzed the pattern of barrier marker expression following unilateral neural tube deletions. We found that PNA-negative axon pathways developed normally even in the virtual absence of axon outgrowth. We conclude that the absence of staining with carbohydrate-specific barrier markers is an independent characteristic of the cells that comprise axon pathways. These results identify two molecular markers that characterize known functional barriers to axon advance and suggest that barrier tissues may impose patterns on peripheral nerve outgrowth by virtue of their distinct molecular composition.},

	Abstract = {Characteristics of the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (CS/DSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) from retinas of 14-day chicken embryos were examined following specific lyase digestion of the HSPG and CS/DSPG glycosaminoglycans, respectively. On the basis of gel exclusion chromatography the prevalent CS/DSPGs in the tissue were above Mr 400 × 103 with two or three glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr 60--70 × 103. The HSPGs existed in two distinct populations in the tissue. Those in the dominant population appeared to be in the range of Mr 250--300 × 103 with 9 to 12 glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr 15--25 × 103. The other population consisted of free heparan sulfate chains of Mr15--25 × 103. The HSPGs in the medium tended to be intermediate in size. To examine the distribution of proteoglycans, tissues were sequentially homogenized and extracted in saline and reextracted with 4  guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and Triton X-100 (TX), or they were washed in heparin solution and dissociated to single cells with trypsin before sequential extraction in saline and GdnHCl with TX. Through comparison of the results of these two extraction methods, CS/DSPGs were found to be almost entirely within the medium or matrix or loosely associated with the cell surface, and most HSPGs were associated with either the basal lamina or the plasma membrane. The single heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains appeared to be intracellular degradation products. These results support reports that CS/DSPGs may be present in the retina interphotoreceptor matrix and that HSPGs may be present in regions of synaptogenesis, associated with cell membranes.},

	Abstract = {Immunohistochemistry of embryonic chick central nervous system (CNS) and immunocytochemistry of retinal cells were performed to compare and map the expression of two barrier-associated molecules. EAP-300 (embryonic avian polypeptide of 300 kDa) and claustrin (a 320 kDa extracellular matrix keratan sulfate proteoglycan) were both transiently expressed in CNS regions that are considered non-permissive to either neuron migration or axon growth In the developing spinal cord, EAP-300 and claustrin were both expressed by the marginal zone early in development and by the roof plate later in embryogenesis. In the developing rhombencephalon, immunoreactivity for both molecules was also observed first in the midline, and this expression represented a continuation of the expression observed in the spinal cord roof plate and hindbrain ventral midline. In the developing retina and cerebellum, EAP-300 and claustrin were differentially expressed. In retina, EAP-300 and claustrin were expressed by M{\"u}ller cells and the optic fiber layer, respectively. In cerebellum at embryonic day 12 (E12), EAP-300 was expressed by Bergman glia, but claustrin as not expressed until E15. Immunocytochemical staining of retinal and cerebellar cultures indicated that EAP-300 was expressed by a subset of radial astrocytes, as confirmed by double labeling experiments with a specific marker for radial astrocytes. These data indicate that in the absence of claustrin expression, EAP-300 was expressed specifically by radial astrocytes during developmental periods of neuron migration. Also, the coexpression on EAP-300 and claustrin in CNS regions considered to be non-permissive to neurite extension suggests that these two developmentally regulated proteins may be associated with barrier function in the developing CNS.},

@article{kroger90,
	Abstract = {The external limiting membrane of the avian embryonic optic tectum is isolated by mechanically separating the neuronal mesencephalon from the overlying mesenchymal tissue. The preparation consists of a basal lamina which is covered on its neural side by endfeet of neuroepithelial cells and has attached to it on its meningeal side a collageneous stroma, containing blood vessels. The external limiting membrane can be flat-mounted on a piece of nitrocellulose filter as mechanical support. It covers an area between 0.3 and 1 the cm2, depending on the age of me donor embryo. The endfeet can be removed together with all cellular components of the meninges by treatment with 2% Triton-X-100 or with distilled water. The basal lamina itself is approximately 80 nm thick and consists of two laminae rarae and a central lamina densa. Immunohistochemical staining reveals that the basal lamina in the embryo, after isolation and after detergent extraction of the isolated preparation, contains type IV collagen, nidogen, laminin, and low density heparan sulfate proteoglycan as do other basement membranes. Antibodies against the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and fibronectin fail to stain the external limiting membrane, but these proteins were clearly identified in the blood vessel-containing meninges or in the optic tectum.
The flat-mounted external limiting membrane preparation was used as substrate to culture several different neural tissues of central and peripheral origin. Explants of neural crest cells, dorsal root ganglia, and sympathetic ganglia can be cultured on the external limiting membrane. All explants grow well on the basal lamina preparations whether the endfeet are attached or detergent-extracted prior to explantation; however, neurite outgrowth from sympathetic ganglia is reduced in the presence of the endfeet. Although the endfoot-lined external limiting membrane represents at least part of the immediate environment encountered by retinal axons as they invade the optic tectum and despite its excellent properties as a substrate for retinal axons in vitro, cues guiding the orientation of axons were not detected in the flat-mounted preparation.},

	Abstract = {Recently, Schulz and coworkers45 purified a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from the superior colliculus of the neonatal rat which promoted survival of neonatal rat retinal ganglion cells in vitro. The present work tests whether this factor supports the survival of axotomised retinal ganglion cells in vivo. To this effect, murine retinae 15 and 20 days after conception were explanted to the chorioallantoic membrane of live chicken embryos. The explants, which were left in the egg for 1, 2 or 7 days, differentiated and grew according to a normal timetable. Purified proteoglycan from neonatal rat superior colliculus was applied daily to one group of retinae while a control group received Ham's F-10 medium. Results indicated that application of proteoglycan resulted in the preferential survival of large cells in the ganglion cell layer, namely ganglion cells, for up to 7 days post-explantation. In addition, the proteoglycan had a significant short-term anti-traumatic effect on the ganglion cell layer of explants by causing a 72% decrease in the number of dead cells relative to controls 1 day post-explantation. It was concluded that the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan purified from the superior colliculus of the neonatal rat promotes the survival of fetal and neonatal murine retinal ganglion cells in retinae explanted to the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick.},

@article{fichard91,
	Abstract = {In 7-day chick embryo dorsal root ganglia and epidermis cocultures, nerve fibers avoid the epidermis. Previous studies have indicated that glycoproteic factors, secreted by epidermis, could be involved in this phenomenon. Treatment of epidermis by β- -xyloside, a specific proteoglycan synthesis inhibitor, abolishes the avoidance reaction. The same result is obtained when anti-chondroitin sulfate antibodies are added to the culture medium. Using HPLC and 35SO4 labeling combined with chondroitinase and hyaluronidase treatment, it has been demonstrated that chondroitin sulfate is present in the epidermal conditioned medium. This suggests that a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan secreted by the epidermis is implicated in the neurite avoidance reaction and that epidermis could therefore control its own ``noninnervation''. In vivo, inhibitory influences by local extracellular components may control the guidance of growth cones during nerve pattern formation.

	Abstract = {Sulfated proteoglycans (PGs) may play a significant role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. They are present in axon-free regions of the developing nervous system and repel elongating neurites in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The addition of growth-promoting molecules, such as laminin, can modify the inhibitory effect of PGs on neurite outgrowth (Snow, Steindler, and Silver, 1990b). Substrata containing a high-PG/low-laminin ratio completely inhibit neurite outgrowth, while normal, unimpeded outgrowth is observed on low-PG/high-laminin substrata. Therefore, different patterns of neurite outgrowth may result from regulation of the ratio of growth-promoting molecules to growth-inhibiting molecules. Using video microscopy, embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRG), chicken retinal ganglia neurons (RGC), and rat forebrain neurons (FB) were analyzed as they extended processes from a substratum consisting of laminin alone onto a step gradient of increasing concentrations of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PG) bound to laminin. In contrast to neurite outgrowth inhibition that occurs at the border of a single stripe of high concentration of CS-PG (Snow et al., 1990b and this study), growth cones grew onto and up CS-PG presented in a step-wise graded distribution. Although the behavior of the different cell types was unique, a common behavior of each cell type was a decrease in the rate of neurite outgrowth with increasing CS-PG concentration. These data suggest that appropriate concentrations of growth-promoting molecules combined with growth-inhibiting molecules may regulate the direction and possibly the timing of neurite outgrowth in vivo. The different responses of different neuronal types suggest that the presence of sulfated PG may have varying effects on different aspects of neuronal development.},

required for neuronal survival. Binding of neurotrophins to 
Trk receptor tyrosine kinases initiate signaling cascades that 
promote cell survival and differentiation. All family members 
bind to another receptor (p75NTR), which belongs to the tumor 
necrosis factor superfamily. Hence, nerve growth factor (NGF) 
and related trophic factors are unique in that two separate 
receptor types are utilized. Although the biological function of 
p75NTR has been elusive, it has been suggested to mediate 
apoptosis of developing neurons in the absence of Trk 
receptors. This presents a tantalizing paradigm, in which life- 
death decisions of cells are dependent upon the expression 
and action of two different receptors with distinctive signaling 
mechanisms. In the presence of TrkA receptors, p75 can 
participate in the formation of high affinity binding sites and 
enhanced NGF responsiveness leading to a survival signal. In 
the absence of TrkA receptors, p75 can generate, in only 
specific cell populations, a death signal. Here we discuss the 
unique features and implications of this unusual signal 
transduction system. },

	Abstract = {The binding interactions for the three primary reactants of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system, basic FGF (bFGF), an FGF receptor, FGFR1, and the cofactor heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), were explored by isothermal titrating calorimetry, ultracentrifugation, and molecular modeling. The binding reactions were first dissected into three binary reactions: (1) FGFRl + bFGF - FGFRl/bFGF, K1 = 41 (+/-12) nM; (2) FGFRl + HS - FGFRl/HS, K2 = 104 (+/-17) pM; and (3) bFGF + HS - bFGF/HS, 
K3 = 470 (+/-20) nM, where HS = low MW heparin, -3 kDa. The first, binding of bFGF to FGFRl in the absence of HS, was found to be a simple binary binding reaction that is enthalpy dominated and characterized by a single equilibrium constant, K1. The conditional reactions of bFGF and FGFRl in the presence of heparin were then examined under conditions that saturate only the bFGF heparin site (1.5 equiv of HS/bFGF) or saturate the HS binding sites of both bFGF and FGFRl (1.0 mM HS). Both 3- 
and 5-kDa low MW heparins increased the affinity for FGFRl binding to bFGF by - 10-fold (Kd = 4.9 +/- 2.0 nM), relative to the reaction with no HS. In addition, HS, at a minimum of 1.5 equiv/bFGF, induced a second FGFRl molecule to bind to another lower affinity secondary site on bFGF (K4 = 1.9 +/- 0.7 pM) in an entropy-dominated reaction to yield a quaternary complex containing two FGFRl , one bFGF, and at least one HS. Molecular weight estimates by analytical ultracentrifugation of such fully bound complexes were consistent with this proposed composition. To understand these binding reactions in terms of structural components of FGFRl, a three-dimensional model of FGFRl was constructed using segment match modeling. Electrostatic potential calculations confirmed that an elongated cluster, - 15 X 35 A, of nine cationic 
residues focused positive potential (+2kbT) to the solvent-exposed beta-sheet 
A, B, E, C' surface of the D(II) domain model, strongly implicating this locus as the HS binding region of FGFR1. Structural models for HS binding to FGFRl, and HS binding to bFGF, were built individually and then assembled to juxtapose adjacent binding sites for receptor and HS on bFGF, against matching proposed growth factor and HS binding sites on FGFRl . The calorimetric binding results and the molecular modeling exercises suggest that bFGF and HS participate in a concerted bridge mechanism for the dimerization of FGFRl in vitro and presumably for mitogenic signal transduction in vivo. The thermodynamic driving force for receptor dimerization can be explained in terms of allosteric multivalent binding reactions that allow for the cooperative energetic coupling of heparin binding reactions on FGFRl and bFGF, reactions 2 and 3, with growth factor/receptor binding events, reactions 1 and 4. Finally, the observation that pentosan polysulfate binds to FGFRl with a 10-fold higher affinity than HS [Kd = 10.9 (+/-3.5) pM] may provide an opportunity to reexamine the mechanism of action of this sulfated oligosaccharide and other related inhibitors of angiogenesis currently under investigation for the treatment of breast cancer and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma.},

	Abstract = {A central tenet of nerve growth factor (NGF) action 
that is poorly understood is its ability to mediate 
cytoplasmic signaling, through its receptor TrkA, 
that is initiated at the nerve terminal and conveyed to the 
soma. We identified an NGF-induced protein that we termed 
Pincher (pinocytic chaperone) that mediates endocytosis and 
trafficking of NGF and its receptor TrkA. In PC12 cells, 
overexpression of Pincher dramatically stimulated NGF- 
induced endocytosis of TrkA, unexpectedly at sites of 
clathrin-independent macropinocytosis within cell surface  
ruffles. Subsequently, a system of Pincher-containing tubules 
mediated the delivery of NGF/TrkA-containing vesicles to 
cytoplasmic accumulations. These vesicles selectively and 
persistently mediated TrkA-erk5 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase signaling. A dominant inhibitory mutant form of 
Pincher inhibited the NGF-induced endocytosis of TrkA, and 
selectively blocked TrkA-mediated cytoplasmic signaling of 
erk5, but not erk1/2, kinases. Our results indicate that Pincher 
mediates pinocytic endocytosis of functionally specialized 
NGF/TrkA endosomes with persistent signaling potential. },

	Abstract = {Prior to forming an axon, retinal ganglion 
cells retain a primitive radial configuration while maintaining 
ventricular and vitreal endfeet attachments. During their sub- 
sequent differentiation, ganglion cells polarize their cell body 
and axon only along the vitreal surface. When the ventricular 
surfaces of intact retinas in organ culture were exposed to free 
chondroitin sulfate (CS) in solution, both the cell body and 
nerve fiber layers were repolarized to the opposite side of the 
neuroepithelium. However, the basal lamina remained in its 
usual position. Thus, the ability to initiate an axon is not 
restricted to the vitreal endfoot region of differentiating neu- 
rons, and in addition, the radial position at which the axon 
emerges can be mediated by the location and concentration of 
the extracellular CS milieu.

@article{golding99,
	Abstract = {During mammalian hindbrain development, sensory axons grow along highly stereotyped routes within the cranial 
mesenchyme to reach their appropriate entry points into the neuroepithelium. Thus, trigeminal ganglion axons always 
project to rhombomere (r)2, whilst facial/acoustic ganglia axons always project to r4. Axons are never observed to enter the 
mesenchyme adjacent to r3, raising the possibility that r3 mesenchyme contains an axon growth-inhibitory activity. 
Conversely, in mice which lack the erbB4 receptor (normally expressed in r3), trigeminal and facial/acoustic ganglia axons 
misproject into r3 mesenchyme, suggesting that the putative axon barrier is absent. To investigate this hypothesis, we have 
developed an in vitro model in which dissociated wild-type embryonic trigeminal ganglion neurons are cultured on 
longitudinal cryosections of embryonic mouse head. We observed that on wild-type embryonic day 10 (E10) cryosections, 
neurites generally failed to grow into r3 mesenchyme from the adjacent r2 or r4 mesenchyme. This barrier was removed if 
cryosections were pretreated with chondroitinase or were washed with excess chondroitin 6-sulphate or hypertonic saline. 
By contrast, when trigeminal neurons were seeded onto cryosections of E10 erbB4 -/- embryo heads their neurites readily 
entered mutant r3 mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated chondroitin-sulphated proteoglycans 
throughout the cranial mesenchyme in both wild-type and erbB4 -/- embryos. We propose that trigeminal axons are 
excluded from wild-type r3 mesenchyme by a growth-inhibitory activity which associates with chondroitin-sulphated 
proteoglycans and that the synthesis of this activity may rely on signals transduced by erbB receptors.},

@article{inatani00,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE. Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan present 
exclusively in central nervous system tissues. In the current study the expression pattern and 
characterization of NGC during the development of the retina were investigated. 
METHODS. Expressional changes of NGC mRNAs during rat retinal development were examined by 
semiquantitative reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The localization and 
characterization of NGC core proteins were investigated by immunoblot analysis and immunohis- 
tochemistry using an anti-NGC antibody. 
RESULTS. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NGC was highly expressed in the nerve fiber 
layer (NFL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) in rat postnatal developing retina. At embryonal stages, 
NGC immunoreactivities were faint. In contrast, at postnatal developmental stages (approximately 
postnatal day [P]7), intense immunoreactivity was observed in the NFL and IPL, where active 
dendrite branching was observed, and conventional synapses began to be formed. As retinal layer 
differentiation proceeded (from P14 to P42), immunoreactivities in the inner retinal layers gradually 
became fainter. Immunoblot and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the peak level of 
NGC expression occurred on approximately P7 and P14. Glycosylation of the NGC core protein 
changed as the retinal layers matured. In immunoelectron microscopic analysis, NGC immunore- 
activity was located on the axonal membranes of neuronal cells in the postnatal retina, whereas 
immunoreactivity was reduced on membranes at the adult stage. In retinal ganglion cells in vitro, 
NGC was highly localized in their spiny budding neurites. 
CONCLUSIONS. The results show spatiotemporal expression patterns of NGC, and suggest that it plays 
a role in the formation of neural networks in retinal development. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

	Abstract = {Slit proteins are a family of secreted guidance proteins that can repel neuronal migration and axon growth via interaction with their cellular roundabout receptors (Robos). Here it was shown that Slit2--Robo-1 interactions were enhanced by cell-surface heparan sulfate. Removal of heparan sulfate decreased the affinity of Slit for Robo by about threefold. In addition, removal of cell-surface heparan sulfate by heparinase III abolished the chemorepulsive response to Slit2 normally shown by both the migrating neurons and growing axons. These results indicate essential roles for cell-surface heparan sulfate in the repulsive activities of Slit2. },

	Abstract = {We have isolated and  characterized  the cell-associated  and  secreted  proteoglycans synthesized by a clonal line of rat  adrenal medullary  PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, which have been extensively employed for  the study of a  wide  variety of neurobiological processes. Chondroitin sulfate  accounts  for 70-80% of the [%3] sulfate-labeled proteoglycans present in PC12 cells and  secreted  into  the medium. Two  major  chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were  detected  with molecular sizes of 45,000-100,000  and  120,000-190,000, comprising  14-  and  105-kDa  core  proteins  and  one  or  two chondroitin  sulfate  chains  with an  average molecular size of 34 kDa. In  contrast  to  the  chondroitin  sulfate proteoglycans,  one  major heparan  sulfate proteoglycan accounts  for most of the  remaining 20-30% of the [3''S] sulfate-labeled  proteoglycans present  in  the  PC12 cells and medium. It has a molecular size of 95,000-170,000, comprising a 65-kDa  core  protein  and  two  to six  16-kDa  heparan  sulfate chains.  Both the chondroitin  sulfate  and  heparan  sulfate proteoglycans  also contain 0-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides (25-28% of the  total  oligosaccharides) and  predominantly tri- and  tetraantennary N-glycosidic  oligosaccharides. Proteoglycans produced by the original clone of PC12 cells were compared with those of two  other PC12 cell lines  (B2  and  F3)  that  differ  from  the  original clone in morphology,  adhesive  properties, and  response to  nerve  growth  factor. Although the F3 cells (a mutant  line  derived  from  B2  and  reported  to  lack  a cell surface  heparan  sulfate  proteoglycan) do not contain a large molecular  size heparan  sulfate  proteoglycan species, there  was no significant  difference between the B2 and F3 cells in  the  percentage of total heparan  sulfate  released  by mild trypsinization,  and both the  B2  and F3 cells  synthesized  cell-associated and  secreted  chondroitin  sulfate  and  heparan  sulfate proteoglycans  having properties  very  similar  to those of the  original  PC12 cell line  but  with a reversed  ratio (35:65) of chondroitin  sulfate to  heparan  sulfate},

	Abstract = {The composition and biosynthesis of glycoproteins, 
proteoglycans, and gangliosides have been studied in a 
clonal line of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12)  cells.  Gly- 
coproteins account for approximately 78%  of the glu- 
cosamine-labeled  complex carbohydrates found in the 
culture medium, together with 17% chondroitin sulfate 
and 5% heparan sulfate. 10% of the glycoproteins but 
less  than 
1% 
of the proteoglycans are released by tryp- 
sin treatment of the cells,  whose  complex carbohy- 
drates  are composed of 93% glycoproteins, 1.3% chon- 
droitin sulfate, 3.4% heparan sulfate, and 2.6%  of mono- 
and disialogangliosides. Sequential lectin affinity chro- 
matography and alkali treatment of glycopeptides pre- 
pared from the medium, trypsin-releasable, membrane, 
and cell-soluble glycoproteins demonstrated that in all 
of the subfractions large tri- and tetraantennary com- 
plex oligosaccharides account for 82 to 97%  of those 
present in PC12 cell glycoproteins. Biantennary oligo- 
saccharides account for approximately 2-6% of those 
in medium and trypsinate, as compared to 10-13% in 
the membrane and cell soluble glycoproteins, and  there 
were large differences (ranging from 7 to 60%) in the 
proportions of biantennary oligosaccharides which are 
substituted by  fucose on the core N-acetylglucosamine 
which is linked to asparagine. High mannose oligosac- 
charides are present predominantly in  the cell  mem- 
brane  and soluble glycoproteins, where they account 
for 4 to 6% of the  total glycoprotein labeling. 
In response to nerve growth factor (NGF`), the PC12 
cells extend long processes and acquire other  proper- 
ties similar to those of differentiated sympathetic neu- 
rons. Significant alterations were also observed in the 
complex carbohydrates of NGF-treated cells, the most 
striking of which were an almost 3-fold increase  in 
labeled gangliosides and a 75% increase in trypsin-re- 
leasable glycoproteins. Cellular heparan sulfate de- 
creased by  70% in response to NGF and increased by 
an equivalent amount in  the  culture 
medium, whereas 
an NGF-induced increase in chondroitin sulfate label- 
ing occurred specifically in the cell membranes.

	Abstract = {Soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), pre- 
pared from lo-d-old rat brain, were added to the culture 
medium of PCl2D cells containing NGF to examine the ef- 
fects on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from the cells. PC1 2D 
cells, a flat-shaped variant of PC1 2 pheochromocytoma cells, 
are characteristic of prompt neurite formation in response 
not only to NGF, but also to CAMP-enhancing reagents such 
as forskolin. Brain CSPGs inhibited the neurite elongation 
irreversibly in a dose-dependent manner; complete inhibi- 
tion was observed at a concentration of 50 nmol uranic acid/ 
ml. Closely similar dose-dependent inhibition was observed 
in the forskolin-induced neurite outgrowth from PC1 2D cells. 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from conventional PC1 2 cells 
was also inhibited completely by 50 nmol uranic acid/ml 
CSPGs. Some brain CSPGs seemed to be inhibitory, but the 
cartilage-unique CSPG did not show any inhibitory effect. 
Chondroitin sulfate, a polysaccharide moiety of CSPGs, did 
not show any inhibitory effect even at a concentration of 250 
nmol uranic acid/ml, while core proteins prepared from brain 
CSPGs by digestion with chondroitinase ABC exhibited in- 
hibitory activity similar to that of intact CSPGs. This indicates 
that the site of the inhibitory activity exists in the core protein 
moiety of brain CSPGs. From these observations, it is con- 
ceivable that brain CSPGs are involved in the regulation of 
neuronal differentiation.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT The generation of neurons in the vertebrate retina, as in other areas of the 
developing nervous system, largely depends on extracellular signals. Of the known signaling 
molecules, neurotrophins play decisive, defined, and distinct roles. The three neurotrophins 
identified in the chick, namely, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 
and nerve growth factor (NGF), are expressed in either the pigment epithelium (NT-3 and BDNF) or 
in the neural retina (NGF) at the onset of neuron birth. In addition, trkC and trkB, receptors for 
NT-3 and BDNF, respectively, together with p75, the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor, are 
expressed in the retina at the same developmental period. The role of these three neurotrophins in 
the differentiation of neurons in the chick retina has been elucidated by a combination of in vitro and 
in vivo experiments. Thus, NT-3 promotes the conversion of neuroepithelial cells into neurons, 
whereas BDNF and NGF control the programmed cell death (apoptosis) that affects early 
postmitotic neuroblasts. BDNF, acting via its trkB receptor, is a survival factor for these cells, 
whereas NGF, binding to p75 receptor, acts as a killing factor, thereby controlling the provisional 
number of newly generated neurons. Microsc. Res. Tech. 45:243--251, 1999.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescent lipophilic dyes are an ideal tool to study axonal pathfinding. Because 
these dyes do not require active axonal transport for their spreading, they can be used in fixed tissue. 
Here, we describe the method we have used to study the molecular mechanisms of commissural axon 
pathfinding in the embryonic chicken spinal cord in vivo. Based on in vitro studies, different families 
of molecules had been suggested to play a role in the guidance of developing axons. In order to test 
their function in vivo, we used the commissural neurons that are located at the dorsolateral border 
of the chicken spinal cord as a model system [Stoeckli and Landmesser (1995) Neuron 14:1165-- 
1179]. Axonin-1, NgCAM, and NrCAM, three members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of 
cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), were shown to be important for the correct growth pattern of 
commissural axons. We studied the effect of perturbations of specific CAM/CAM interactions by 
injection of function-blocking antibodies into the central canal of the spinal cord in ovo. After 2 days, 
the embryos were sacrificed and fluorescent tracers, such as Fast-DiI, were used to visualize 
commissural axons, and thus, to analyze their response to these perturbations in two different types 
of fixed preparations: transverse vibratome sections and whole-mount preparations of the spinal 
cord. Both pathfinding errors and defasciculation of axons were observed as a result of the 
perturbation of CAM/CAM interactions. Microsc. Res. Tech. 48:25--31, 2000.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism by which target-derived Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) signaling is propagated retrogradely, over extremely long distances, to cell bodies to support survival of neurons is unclear. Here we show that  survival of sympathetic neurons supported by NGF on distal axons requires the kinase activity of the NGF 
receptor, TrkA, in both distal axons and cell bodies. In contrast, disruption of TrkA activity exclusively in proximal axonal segments affects neither retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling in cell bodies nor neuronal survival. Ligand-receptor internalization is necessary for survival of neurons supported by NGF on distal axons. Furthermore, antibody neutralization experiments indicate that retrogradely transported NGF, within cell bodies, is critical for neuronal survival but not for growth of distal axons. Taken together, our results indicate that retrogradely transported NGF-TrkA complexes promote sympathetic neuron survival.},

@article{irie08,
	Abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that many signaling pathways in- 
volve not only ligands and receptors but also various types of 
coreceptors and matrix components as additional layers of regu- 
lation. Signaling by Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands plays a 
key role in a variety of biological processes, such as axon guidance 
and topographic map formation, synaptic plasticity, angiogenesis, 
and cancer. Little is known about whether the ephrin-Eph receptor 
signaling system is subject to such additional layers of regulation. 
Here, we show that ephrin-A3 binds to heparan sulfate, and that 
the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate is required for the full 
biological activity of ephrin-A3. Among the ephrins tested, includ- 
ing ephrin-A1, -A2, -A5, -B1, and -B2, only ephrin-A3 binds heparin 
or heparan sulfate. Ephrin-A3-dependent EphA receptor activation 
is reduced in mutant cells that are defective in heparan sulfate 
synthesis, in wild-type cells from which cell surface heparan sulfate 
has been removed, and in the hippocampus of conditional knock- 
out mice defective in heparan sulfate synthesis. Ephrin-A3-depen- 
dent cell rounding is impaired in CHO cells lacking heparan sulfate, 
and cortical neurons lacking heparan sulfate exhibit impaired 
growth cone collapse. In contrast, cell rounding and growth cone 
collapse in response to ephrin-A5, which does not bind heparan 
sulfate, are not affected by the absence of heparan sulfate. These 
results show that heparan sulfate modulates ephrin/Eph signaling 
and suggest a physiological role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans 
in the regulation of ephrin-A3-dependent biological processes. },

@article{mohammadi05,
	Abstract = {Heparan sulfate (HS) is an essential and dynamic regulator 
of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Two 
fundamentally different crystallographic models have been 
proposed to explain, at the molecular level, how HS/heparin 
enables FGF and FGF receptor (FGFR) to assemble into a 
functional dimer on the cell surface. In the symmetric `two- 
end' model, the heparin-binding sites of FGF and FGFR 
merge to form a basic canyon that recruits two HS for 
binding. Within this canyon, the HS molecules primarily act 
to orchestrate and fortify multivalent and cooperative 
protein--protein contacts within the dimer that are the 
foundations of dimerization. In contrast, in the asymmetric 
model, which mechanistically resembles the previously 
proposed trans FGF dimer model, a single heparin molecule 
facilitates dimerization by cross-linking two FGFs into a trans 
dimer that brings together the two FGFRs. Interestingly, the 
crystal structure upon which the asymmetric model is based 
contains a symmetric dimer reminiscent of the symmetric 
two-end model, suggesting that a different interpretation of 
the crystal structure has led to the postulation of the 
asymmetric model. Importantly, the symmetric two-end 
model provides an intriguing solution to the problem of how 
HS selectivity is achieved in FGF signaling. The model 
reveals that, within the canyon, FGF and FGFR no longer 
adhere to their individual HS binding specificities, but 
instead act in unison to search for a unique HS motif from a 
plethora of HS epitopes that are expressed in a tissue- 
specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Primary 
sequence differences within the heparin-binding sites of 
FGFs and FGFRs, together with ligand-induced changes in 
FGFR conformation, lead to the formation of distinct 
canyons with unique HS specificity for individual FGF--FGFR 
complexes.

	Abstract = {Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally 
related proteins with a wide range of physiological and patho- 
logical activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF 
with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate 
proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct 
involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysac- 
charide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor 
is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of
binary complexes of FGF $\pm$ heparin6,7 and FGF $\pm$ FGFR8,9 have been 
described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling com- 
plex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure 
of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by 
simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The 
complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking 
two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor 
chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with 
both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure 
of the FGF1 $\pm$ FGFR2 $\pm$ heparin ternary complex provides a struc- 
tural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF 
signalling. },

	Abstract = {Activation of specific tyrosine kinase receptors by 
neurotrophins accounts for the longest known biological 
actions of the neurotrophins, in particular the promotion of 
neuronal survival. However, recent studies have revealed 
that nerve growth factor, the neurotrophin regarded as best 
understood, also activates a signalling pathway by binding to 
the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. This receptor belongs to 
the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and lacks intrinsic 
catalytic activity. The p75NTR receptor binds all neurotrophins 
with nanomolar affinity; however, nerve growth factor seems 
to be uniquely able to activate it, causing the death of 
MA-negative neurons during normal development. Thus, nerve 
growth factor prevents programmed cell death through its 
receptor TrkA, but promotes it by signalling through p75NTR.

	Abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate are extracellular sugar chains involved in intercellular signalling. Disruptions of genes encoding enzymes that mediate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis have severe consequences in Drosophila and mice1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Mutations in the Drosophila gene sugarless, which encodes a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, impairs developmental signalling through the Wnt family member Wingless, and signalling by the fibroblast growth factor and Hedgehog pathways. Heparan sulphate is involved in these pathways6, 7, 8, but little is known about the involvement of chondroitin. Undersulphated and oversulphated chondroitin sulphate chains have been implicated in other biological processes, however, including adhesion of erythrocytes infected with malaria parasite to human placenta and regulation of neural development9, 10. To investigate chondroitin functions, we cloned a chondroitin synthase homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans and depleted expression of its product by RNA-mediated interference and deletion mutagenesis. Here we report that blocking chondroitin synthesis results in cytokinesis defects in early embryogenesis. Reversion of cytokinesis is often observed in chondroitin-depleted embryos, and cell division eventually stops, resulting in early embryonic death. Our findings show that chondroitin is required for embryonic cytokinesis and cell division.},

	Abstract = {The response of neuronal growth cones to axon guidance cues depends on the developmental context in which these cues are encountered. We show here that the transmembrane protein semaphorin 5A (Sema5A) is a bifunctional guidance cue exerting both attractive and inhibitory effects on developing axons of the fasciculus retroflexus, a diencephalon fiber tract associated with limbic function. The thrombospondin repeats of Sema5A physically interact with the glycosaminoglycan portion of both chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). CSPGs function as precisely localized extrinsic cues that convert Sema5A from an attractive to an inhibitory guidance cue. Therefore, glycosaminoglycan bound guidance cues provide a molecular mechanism for CSPG-mediated inhibition of axonal extension. Further, axonal HSPGs are required for Sema5A-mediated attraction, suggesting that HSPGs are components of functional Sema5A receptors. Thus, neuronal responses to Sema5A are proteoglycan dependent and interpreted according to the biological context in which this membrane bound guidance cue is presented. },

	Abstract = {In the developing retina, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) 
axons elongate toward the optic fissure, even though no 
obvious directional restrictions exist. Previous studies 
indicate that axon-matrix interactions are important for 
retina] ganglion cell axon elongation, but the factors that 
direct elongation are unknown. Chondroitin sulfate 
proteoglycan (CS-PG), a component of the extracellular 
matrix, repels elongating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 
axons in vitro and is present in vivo in the roof plate of the 
spinal cord, a structure that acts as a barrier to DRG 
axons during development. In this study, we examined 
whether CS-PG may regulate the pattern of retinal 
ganglion cell outgrowth in the developing retina. 
Immunocytochemical analysis showed that CS-PG 
was present in the innermost layers of the developing rat 
retina. The expression of CS-PG moved peripherally 
with retinal development, always remaining at the outer 
edge of the front of the developing axons. CS-PG was no 
longer detectable with immunocytochemical techniques 
when RGC axon elongation in the retina is complete. 
Results of studies in vitro showed that CS-PG, isolated 
from bovine nasal cartilage and chick limb, was 
inhibitory to elongating RGC axons and that RGC 
growth cones were more sensitive to CS-PG than were 
DRG neurites tested at the same concentrations of CS- 
PG. The behavior of retinal growth cones as they 
encounter CS-PG was characterized using time-lapse 
video microscopy. Filopodia of the RGC growth cones 
extended to and sampled the CS-PG repeatedly. With 
time, the growth cones turned to avoid outgrowth on the 
CS-PG and grew only on laminin. 
While numerous studies have shown the presence of 
positive factors within the retina that may guide 
developing RGC axons, this is the first demonstration of 
an inhibitory or repelling molecule in the retina that may 
regulate axon elongation. Taken together, these data 
suggest that the direction of RGC outgrowth in the 
retina may be regulated by the proper ratio of growth- 
promoting molecules, such as laminin, to growth- 
inhibiting molecules, like CS-PG, present in the correct 
pattern and concentrations along the retinal ganglion 
cell pathway.

	Abstract = {The control of cell movement during development is essential for forming and stabilizing the spatial organization of tissues and cell types. During initial steps of tissue patterning, distinct regional domains or cell types arise at appropriate locations, and the movement of cells is constrained in order to maintain spatial relationships during growth. In other situations, the guidance of migrating cells or neuronal growth cones to specific destinations underlies the establishment or remodelling of a pattern. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are key players in controlling these cell movements in many tissues and at multiple stages of patterning.

	Abstract = {Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from each eye execute a series of maneuvers as they converge on the ventral surface of the brain at the 
optic chiasm for sorting into the optic tracts. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are extracellular glycoproteins involved in cell- 
surface interactions. HSPGs exhibit massive structural diversity, conferred partly by extensive post-translational modification including 
differential sulfation. Here we examine the roles of HSPG sulfation in RGC axon guidance at the chiasm. We identified different axon 
navigation phenotypes in two heparan sulfate sulfotransferase (Hst) mutant embryos, Hs2st-/- and Hs6st1-/-, each lacking an enzyme 
that catalyzes a particular HSPG modification. Hs2st-/- embryos display axon disorganization at the chiasm. Hs6st1-/- embryos exhibit 
prolific inter-retinal innervation. We show that RGCs express Hs2st and Hs6st1 and that navigation errors made by their axons coincide 
with regions of high Hs2st and/or Hs6st1 expression at the chiasm. Slit proteins are expressed at particular locations in the retina and 
around the chiasm and are normally deployed to prevent axons entering inappropriate territories. We show that Hs2st and/or Hs6st1 
expression coincides with Slit expression domains at locations where RGC axons make navigation errors in Hs2st-/- and Hs6st1-/- 
mutants and that Hs6st1-/- RGC axons are less sensitive to Slit2 repulsion than their wild-type counterparts in vitro. We suggest that (1) 
Hs2st and Hs6st1 are each deployed to generate distinct patterns of heparan sulfation on RGCs and at the optic chiasm and (2) this 
differential sulfation directs retinal axons through the chiasm, at least in part by modulating the response of the navigating growth cone 
to Slit proteins.},

	Abstract = {The effects of removing chondroitin sulfate from 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan molecules on guidance of 
retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic chiasm were 
investigated in a brain slice preparation of mouse embryos 
of embryonic day 13 to 15. Slices were grown for 5 hours 
and growth of dye-labeled axons was traced through the 
chiasm. After continuous enzymatic digestion of the 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans with chondroitinase 
ABC, which removes the glycosaminoglycan chains, 
navigation of retinal axons was disrupted. At embryonic 
day 13, before the uncrossed projection forms in normal 
development, many axons deviated from their normal 
course, crossing the midline at aberrant positions and 
invading the ventral diencephalon. In slices from 
embryonic day 14 embryos, axons that would normally 
form the uncrossed projection at this stage failed to turn 
into the ipsilateral optic tract. In embryonic day 15 slices, 
enzyme treatment caused a reduction of the uncrossed 
projection that develops at this stage. Growth cones in 
enzyme-treated slices showed a significant increase in the 
size both before and after they crossed the midline. This 
indicates that responses of retinal axons to guidance signals 
at the chiasm have changed after removal of the 
chondroitin sulfate epitope. We concluded that the 
chondroitin sulfate moieties of the proteoglycans are 
involved in patterning the early phase of axonal growth 
across the midline and at a later stage controlling the axon 
divergence at the chiasm.

	Abstract = {The axons of the retinal ganglion cells run on the diencepha- 
lotelencephalic boundary on their way to the tectum; however, 
they do not invade the telencephalon anteriorly. To investigate 
the mechanisms that prevent the retinal axons from entering the 
telencephalic territory, the effects of the telencephalic cells 
were examined on the outgrowth of the retinal axons in vitro; 
the retinal outgrowth was selectively inhibited by the cellular 
substrate derived from the telencephalon. The responsible fac- 
tor for the selective inhibition was, furthermore, found in the 
telencephalic membranes and the fraction of peripheral mem- 
brane molecules from the telencephalon. Because the inhibi- 
tory effect was destroyed by chondroitinase ABC but not by 
heat, this inhibition was attributable to the carbohydrate chains 
of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) adhering to the 
membranes of the telencephalic cells. To understand the func- 
tion of the telencephalic CSPGs on the retinal pathfinding in 
vivo, their carbohydrate chains [chondroitin sulfate glycosami- 
noglycan (CS-GAG)] were removed from the embryonic brains 
by intraventricular injection of chondroitinase ABC; the removal 
of CS-GAG resulted in an anterior enlargement of the optic 
tract. The results indicate that the telencephalic cells delimit the 
anterior border of the optic tract with their CSPGs and prevent 
the retinal axons from aberrantly entering the anterior territory.

	Abstract = {Little is known about the cues that 
guide retinal axons across the diencephalon en route to 
their midbrain target, the optic tectum. Here we show 
that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are differentially 
expressed within the diencephalon at a time when retinal 
axons are growing within the optic tract. Using exposed 
brain preparations, we show that the addition of exog- 
enous chondroitin sulfate results in retinal pathfinding 
errors. Retinal axons disperse widely from their normal 
trajectory within the optic tract and extend aberrantly 
into inappropriate regions of the forebrain. Time-lapse 
analysis of retinal growth cone dynamics in vivo shows 
that addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate causes 
intermittent stalling and increases growth cone complex- 
ity. These results suggest that chondroitin sulfate may 
modulate the guidance of retinal axons as they grow 
through the diencephalon towards the optic tectum.

@article{tropea03,
	Abstract = {Damage to the adult CNS often causes devastating and permanent deficits because of the limited capacity of the brain for anatomical 
reorganization. The finding that collateral sprouting of uninjured fiber tracts mediates recovery of function prompts the search for 
experimental strategies that stimulate axonal plasticity after CNS trauma. Here we characterize treatments that promote the sprouting of 
undamaged retinal afferents into the denervated superior colliculus (SC) after a partial retinal lesion in the adult rat. Delivery of brain- 
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was performed to enhance the intrinsic potential of retinal ganglion cells to reelongate their axons. 
Reduction of the neurite growth-inhibitory properties of the adult SC was accomplished via treatment with chondroitinase ABC (C-ABC), 
which degrades chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Retinal axons were labeled via intraocular injections of fluorescently tagged cholera 
toxin B subunit, and fiber sprouting within the denervated SC was measured by quantitative laser-scanning confocal microscopy 1 week 
after the retinal lesion. We found that both the administration of BDNF and the injection of C-ABC induce significant sprouting of retinal 
afferents into the collicular scotoma. Remarkably, the combined treatment with BDNF and C-ABC showed synergistic effects on axon 
growth. Colocalization analysis with anti-synapsin antibodies demonstrated synapse formation by the sprouting axons. These results 
suggest that the combined treatment with BDNF and C-ABC can be relevant in therapies for the repair of the damaged adult CNS. },

	Abstract = {Using molecular cloning techniques, human homologs of the 
known members of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors 
have been cloned and sequenced. Overall, there is a high 
degree of similarity between the human sequences and those 
from other mammals; however, there are differences in splic- 
ing patterns. There are two spliced forms of the extracellular 
domain of trkC in the human, a finding that has not been 
described in other species. In contrast, fewer spliced forms 
were detected of the intracellular domains of human trkB 
and trkC than has been described in other mammals. North- 
ern analysis and in sifu hybridization experiments indicate 
that the human trks are expressed in a similar pattern to that 
described in other mammals. Expression of the trk extra- 
cellular domains as fusion proteins with IgG heavy chain 
yields soluble molecules that mimic intact trks in their bind- 
ing specificity and affinity. These soluble chimeras block the 
biological activity of their cognate neurotrophin(s) in vitro. },

@article{grimes96,
	Abstract = {The survival, differentiation, and maintenance of responsive 
neurons are regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), which is 
secreted by the target and interacts with receptors on the axon 
tip. It is uncertain how the NGF signal is communicated retro- 
gradely from distal axons to neuron cell bodies. Retrograde 
transport of activated receptors in endocytic vesicles could 
convey the signal. However, little is known about endocytosis 
of NGF receptors, and there is no evidence that NGF receptors 
continue to signal after endocytosis. We have examined early 
events in the membrane traffic of NGF and its receptor, 
gp140TrkA (TrkA), in PC12 cells. NGF induced rapid and exten- 
sive endocytosis of TrkA in these cells, and the receptor sub- 
sequently moved into small organelles located near the plasma 
membrane. Some of these organelles contained clathrin and 
alpha-adaptin, which implies that TrkA is internalized by clathrin- 
mediated endocytosis. Using mechanical permeabilization and 
fractionation, intracellular organelles derived from endocytosis 
were separated from the plasma membrane. After NGF treat- 
ment, NGF was bound to TrkA in endocytic organelles, and 
TrkA was tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound to PLC-gamma1, sug- 
gesting that these receptors were competent to initiate signal 
transduction. These studies raise the possibility that NGF in- 
duces formation of signaling endosomes containing activated 
TrkA. They are an important first step in elucidating the molec- 
ular mechanism of NGF retrograde signaling.

	Abstract = {The neurotrophin family of survival factors is distinguished by a unique receptor-signaling system that is composed of two transmembrane receptor proteins. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NF3) and NT-415 share similar protein structures and biological functions and interact with two different types of cell-surface proteins, the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and the ~75, or low-affinity neurotrophin receptor. An important question is whether a dual receptor system is necessary for neurotrophin action. Evidence indicates that co-expression of the two genes for the p75 receptor and the Trk NGF receptor can potentially lead to greater responsiveness to NGF, and suggests additional levels of regulation for the family of neurotrophin factors.

	Abstract = {The neurotrophins are a small group of dimeric proteins that profoundly affect 
the development of the nervous system of vertebrates. Recent studies have 
established clear correlations between the survival requirements for different 
neurotrophins of functionally distinct subsets of sensory neurons. The biological 
role of the neurotrophins is not limited to the prevention of programmed cell 
death of specific groups of neurons during development. Neurotrophin-3 in 
particular seems to act on neurons well before the period of target innervation 
and of normally occuning cell death. In animals lacking functional neurotrophin 
or receptor genes, neuronal numbers do not seem to be massively reduced in the 
CNS, unlike in the PNS. Finally, rapid actions of neurotrophins on synaptic 
efficacy, as well as the regulation of their mRNAs by electrical activity, suggest 
that neurotrophins might play important roles in regulating neuronal connectivity 
in the developing and in the adult central nervous system. },

	Abstract = {Nerve growth factor engages two structurally distinct transmembrane receptors, TrkA and p75, which have been proposed to create a "high-affinity" NGF binding site through formation of a ternary TrkA/NGF/p75 complex. To define a structural basis for the high-affinity site, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a complete extracellular domain of TrkA complexed with NGF. The complex reveals a crab-shaped homodimeric TrkA structure, but a mechanism for p75 coordination is not obvious. We investigated the heterodimerization of membrane-bound TrkA and p75, on intact mammalian cells, using a beta-gal proteinprotein interaction system. We find that NGF dimerizes TrkA and that p75 exists on the cell surface as a preformed oligomer that is not dissociated by NGF. We find no evidence for a direct TrkA/p75 interaction. We propose that TrkA and p75 likely communicate through convergence of downstream signaling pathways and/or shared adaptor molecules, rather than through direct extracellular interactions.},

	Abstract = {The heparin-binding neurotrophic factor midkine (MK) has been proposed to mediate neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth promotion by interacting with cell-surface heparan sulfate. We have observed that over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS) D and CS-E show neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in embryonic day (E) 18 rat hippocampal neurons (Nadanaka, S., Clement, A., Masayama, K., Faissner, A., and Sugahara, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3296-3307). In the present study, various CS isoforms were examined for their ability to inhibit the MK-mediated cell. adhesion of cortical neuronal cells in comparison with heparin from porcine intestine and heparan sulfate from bovine kidney. E17-18 rat cortical neuronal cells were cultured on plates coated with recombinant MK in a grid pattern. The cells attached to and extended their neurites along the MK substratum. Cell adhesion was inhibited by squid cartilage over-sulfated CS-E as well as by heparin, but not by heparan sulfate or other CS isoforms. Direct interactions of MH with various glycosaminoglycans were then evaluated using surface plasmon resonance, showing that CS-E bound MK as strongly as heparin, followed by other over-sulfated CS isoforms, CS-H and CS K. Furthermore, E18 rat brain extracts showed an E disaccharide unit, GlcUA beta1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate). These findings indicate that CS chains containing the E unit as well as heparin-like glycosaminoglycans may be involved in the expression and/or modulation of the multiple neuroregulatory functions of MK such as neuronal adhesion and migration and promotion of neurite outgrowth.},

	Abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes bind to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta via the VAR2CSA protein, a member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 family, leading to life-threatening malaria in pregnant women with severe effects on their fetuses and newborns. Here we describe the structure of the CSA binding DBL3x domain, a Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain of VAR2CSA. By forming a complex of DBL3x with CSA oligosaccharides and determining its structure, we have identified the CSA binding site to be a cluster of conserved positively charged residues on subdomain 2 and subdomain 3. Mutation or chemical modification of lysine residues at the site markedly diminished CSA binding to DBL3x. The location of the CSA binding site is an important step forward in the molecular understanding of pregnancy-associated malaria and offers a new target for vaccine development.},

The key structural determinants responsible for protein binding, such as sulfate groups that participate in the interactions, were elucidated. Specificities were also readily compared across protein families or functional classes, and comparisons among glycosaminoglycan subclasses provided a more comprehensive understanding of protein specificity. To validate the approach, we showed that fibroblast growth factor family members have distinct sulfation preferences. We also demonstrated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate interact in a sulfation-dependent manner with various axon guidance proteins, including slit2, netrin1, ephrinA1, ephrinA5, and semaphorin5B. We anticipate that these microarrays will accelerate the discovery of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins and provide a deeper understanding of their roles in regulating diverse biological processes.},

@article{rigden03,
	Abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase is a surface enzyme of this Gram- positive bacterium. The enzyme degrades hyaluronan and chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfates by cleaving the beta1,4- glycosidic linkage between the glycan units of these polymeric substrates. This degradation helps spreading of this bacterial organism throughout the host tissues and facilitates the disease process caused by pneumococci. The mechanism of this degradative process is based on beta- elimination, is termed proton acceptance and donation, and involves selected residues of a well defined catalytic site of the enzyme. The degradation of hyaluronan alone is thought to proceed through a processive mode of action. The structures of complexes between the enzyme and chondroitin as well as chondroitin sulfate disaccharides allowed for the first detailed insights into these interactions and the mechanism of action on chondroitins. This degradation of chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfates is nonprocessive and is selective for the chondroitin sulfates only with certain sulfation patterns. Chondroitin sulfation at the 4- position on the nonreducing site of the linkage to be cleaved or 2- sulfation prevent degradation due to steric clashes with the enzyme. Evolutionary studies suggest that hyaluronate lyases evolved from chondroitin lyases and still retained chondroitin/ chondroitin sulfate degradation abilities while being specialized in the degradation of hyaluronan. The more efficient processive degradation mechanism has come to be preferred for the unsulfated substrate hyaluronan.},

	Abstract = {Soluble factors from serum such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are thought to activate the small GTP-binding protein Rho based on their ability to induce actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho-dependent manner. Cell adhesion to extracellular matrices (ECM) has also been proposed to activate Rho, but this point has been controversial due to the difficulty of distinguishing changes in Rho activity from the structural contributions of ECM to the formation of focal adhesions. To address these questions, we established an assay for GTP-bound cellular Rho, Plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicited a transient inhibition of Rho, followed by a phase of Rho activation. The activation phase was greatly enhanced by serum. In serum-starved adherent cells, LPA induced transient Rho activation, whereas in suspended cells Rho activation was sustained. Furthermore, suspended cells showed higher Rho activity than adherent cells in the presence of serum. These data indicate the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative-feedback loop, We also observed that both cytochalasin D and colchicine trigger Rho activation despite their opposite effects on stress fibers and focal adhesions. Our results show that ECM, cytoskeletal structures and soluble factors all contribute to regulation of Rho activity.},

Here we describe a quantitative model for the development of one arm of this map the wiring of the nasal - temporal axis of the retina to the caudal rostral axis of the superior colliculus. The model is based on RGC - RGC competition that is governed by comparisons of EphA receptor signalling intensity, which are made using ratios of, rather than absolute differences in, EphA signalling between RGCs(4). Molecular genetic experiments, exploiting a combinatorial series of EphA receptor knock-in and knockout mice, confirm the salient predictions of the model, and show that it both describes and predicts topographic mapping.},

	Abstract = {Axons fail to regenerate in the central nervous system after injury. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) expressed in the scar significantly contribute to the nonpermissive properties of the central nervous system environment. To examine the inhibitory activity of a CSPG mixture on retina ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth, we employed both a stripe assay and a nerve fiber outgrowth assay. We show that the inhibition exerted by CSPGs in vitro can be blocked by application of either C3 transferase, a specific inhibitor of the Rho GTPase, or Y27632, a specific inhibitor of the Rho kinase. These results demonstrate that CSPG-associated inhibition of neurite outgrowth is mediated by the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Consistent with these results, we found that retina ganglion cell axon growth on glial scar tissue was enhanced in the presence of C3 transferase and Y27632, respectively. In addition, we show that the recently identified inhibitory CSPG Te38 is upregulated in the lesioned spinal cord. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitinase B from Pedobacter heparinus is the only known enzyme strictly specific for dermatan sulfate and is a widely used enzymatic tool for the structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans. This beta-helical polysaccharide lyase belongs to family PL-6 and cleaves the beta(1,4) linkage of dermatan sulfate in a random manner, yielding 4,5-unsaturated dermatan sulfate disaccharides as the product. The previously reported structure of its complex with a dermatan sulfate disaccharide product identified the -1 and -2 subsites of the catalytic groove. We present here the structure of chondroitinase B complexed with several dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides. In particular, the soaking of chondroitinase B crystals with a dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide results in a complex with two dermatan sulfate disaccharide reaction products, enabling the identification of the +2 and +1 subsites. Unexpectedly, this structure revealed the presence of a calcium ion coordinated by sequence-conserved acidic residues and by the carboxyl group of the L-iduronic acid at the +1 subsite. Kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have subsequently demonstrated that chondroitinase B absolutely requires calcium for its activity, indicating that the protein-Ca2+-oligosaccharide complex is functionally relevant. Modeling of an intact tetrasaccharide in the active site of chondroitinase B provided a better understanding of substrate specificity and the role of Ca2+ in enzymatic activity. Given these results, we propose that the Ca2+ ion neutralizes the carboxyl moiety of the L-iduronic acid at the cleavage site, whereas the conserved residues Lys-250 and Arg-271 act as Bronsted base and acid, respectively, in the lytic degradation of dermatan sulfate by chondroitinase B.},

	Abstract = {Genetic studies have shown that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions through incompletely understood mechanisms. We report here that ephrin-B1 stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T colorectal epithelial cells inhibited integrin-mediated adhesion and HGF/SF-induced directional cell migration. Using 293 cells stably transfected with wild type (WT)- or kinase-deficient (KD-EphB3), we found that inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and induction of cell rounding was kinase-dependent. Unexpectedly, in two independent assays, both KD- and WT-EphB3 significantly inhibited directional cell migration. Upon ephrin-B1 stimulation, the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 were reduced in both WT- and KD- EphB3-expressing cells that were induced to migrate. Pharmacological evidence demonstrates that a relative increase in RhoA signaling as a result of decreased Rac1/ Cdc42 activities contributes to the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, EphB3-mediated inhibitory effect on cell adhesion but not migration was abolished by the integrin activating antibodies, suggesting that the inhibition of cell migration is not because of down-regulation of integrin function. These results uncover a differential requirement for EphB3 catalytic activity in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, and suggest that while catalytic activity of EphB3 is required for inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, a distinct signaling pathway to Rho GTPases shared by WT- and KD- EphB3 receptor mediates inhibition of directional cell migration.},

	Abstract = {During retinocollicular map development, spontaneous waves of action potentials spread across the retina, correlating activity among neighboring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To address the role of retinal waves in topographic map development, we examined wave dynamics and retinocollicular projections in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. beta2(-/-) mice lack waves during the first postnatal week, but RGCs have high levels of uncorrelated firing. By P8, the wild-type retinocollicular projection remodels into a refined map characterized by axons of neighboring RGCs forming focal termination zones (TZs) of overlapping arbors. In contrast, in P8 beta2(-/-) mice, neighboring RGC axons form large TZs characterized by broadly distributed arbors. At P8, glutamatergic retinal waves appear in beta2(-/-) mice, and later, visually patterned activity appears, but the diffuse TZs fail to remodel. Thus, spontaneous retinal waves that correlate RGC activity are required for retinotopic map remodeling during a brief early critical period.},

	Abstract = {Gradients of axon guidance molecules have long been postulated to control the development of the organization of neural connections into topographic maps. We review progress in identifying molecules required for mapping and the mechanisms by which they act, focusing on the visual system, the predominant model for map development. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, remain the only molecules that meet all criteria for graded topographic guidance molecules, although others fulfill some criteria. Recent reports further define their modes of action and new roles for them, including EphB/ephrin-B control of dorsal-ventral mapping, bidirectional signaling of EphAs/ephrinAs, bifunctional action of ephrins as attractants or repellents in a context-dependent manner, and complex interactions between multiple guidance molecules. In addition, spontaneous patterned neural activity has recently been shown to be required for map refinement during a brief critical period. We speculate on additional activities required for map development and suggest a synthesis of molecular and cellular mechanisms within the context of the complexities of map development.},

	Abstract = {We report that the EphB receptor ligand, ephrin-B1, may act bifunctionally as both a branch repellent and attractant to control the unique mechanisms in mapping the dorsal-ventral (DV) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (LM) axis of the optic tectum. EphB receptors are expressed in a low to high DV gradient by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and ephrin-B1 is expressed in a low to high LM gradient in the tectum. RGC axons lack DV ordering along the LM tectal axis, but directionally extend interstitial branches that establish retinotopically ordered arbors. Recent studies show that ephrin-B1 acts as an attractant in DV mapping and in controlling directional branch extension. Modeling indicates that proper DV mapping requires that this attractant activity cooperates with a repellent activity in a gradient that mimics ephrin-B1. We show that ectopic domains of high, graded ephrin-B1 expression created by retroviral transfection repel interstitial branches of RGC axons and redirect their extension along the LM tectal axis, away from their proper termination zones (TZs). In contrast, the primary RGC axons are unaffected and extend through the ectopic domains of ephrin-B1 and arborize at the topographically correct site. However, when 2407 the location of a TZ is coincident with ectopic domains of ephrin-B1, the domains appear to inhibit arborization and shape the distribution of arbors. Our findings indicate that ephrin-B1 selectively controls, through either attraction or repulsion, the directional extension and arborization of interstitial branches extended by RGC axons arising from the same DV position: branches that arise from axons positioned lateral to the correct TZ are attracted up the gradient of ephrin-B1 and branches that arise from axons positioned medial to the same TZ are repelled down the ephrin-B1 gradient. Alternatively, EphB receptor signaling may act as a Iligand-density sensor' and titrate signaling pathways that promote branch extension toward an optimal ephrin-B1 concentration found at the TZ; branches located either medial or lateral to the TZ would encounter a gradient of increasingly favored attachment in the direction of the TZ.},

	Abstract = {Topographic maps are a fundamental organizational feature of axonal connections in the brain. A prominent model for studying axial polarity and topographic map development is the vertebrate retina and its projection to the optic tectum (or superior colliculus). Linked processes are controlled by molecules that are graded along the axes of the retina and its target fields. Recent studies indicate that ephrin-As control the temporal-nasal mapping of the retina in the optic tectum/superior colliculus by regulating the topographically-specific interstitial branching of retinal axons along the anterior-posterior tectal axis. This branching is mediated by relative levels of EphA receptor repellent signaling. A major recent advance is the demonstration that EphB receptor forward signaling and ephrin-B reverse signaling mediate axon attraction to control dorsal-ventral retinal mapping along the lateral-medial tectal axis. In addition, several classes of regulatory proteins have been implicated in the control of the axial patterning of the retina, and its ultimate readout of topographic mapping.},

Previous reports demonstrated that Eck- and Elk-related receptors in the retina distribute in high temporal-low nasal and high ventral-low dorsal gradients, respectively, While others have focused on complementary ligand gradients in the retinal axon target, the tectum, we report that ligands from each subclass also distribute in gradients opposing those of their corresponding receptors within the retina itself. Moreover, ligand gradients in the retina precede ganglion cell genesis. These results support an intraretinal role for Eph family members in addition to their previously proposed role in the development of retinotectal topography. The distinct distributions of Eph family members suggest that each subclass specifies positional information along independent retinal axes.},

In vitro stripe assays show that dorsal retinal axons prefer to grow on EphB receptor stripes supporting an attractive guidance mechanism. In vivo disruption of EphB/ephrin-B function by application of exogenous EphB or expression of dominant-negative ephrin-B ligand in dorsal retinal axons causes these axons to shift dorsally in the tectum, while misexpression of wild-type ephrin-B in ventral axons causes them to shift ventrally. These dorsoventral targeting errors are consistent with the hypothesis that an attractive mechanism that requires ephrin-B cytoplasmic domain is critical for retinotectal mapping in this axis.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitin lyases (EC 4.2.2.4 and EC 4.2.2.5) are glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes that act as eliminases. Chondroitin lyase AC from Arthrobacter, aurescens (ArthroAC) is known to act on chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate but not on dermatan sulfate. Like other chondroitin AC lyases, it is capable of cleaving hyaluronan. We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of ArthroAC in its native form as well as in complex with its substrates (chondroitin 4-sulfate tetrasaccharide, CStetra and hyaluronan tetrasaccharide) at resolution varying from 1.25 Angstrom to 1.9 Angstrom. The primary sequence of ArthroAC has not been previously determined but it was possible to determine the amino acid sequence of this enzyme from the high-resolution electron density maps and to confirm it by mass spectrometry. The enzyme -substrate complexes were obtained by soaking the substrate into the crystals for varying lengths of time (30 seconds to ten hours) and flash-cooling the crystals. The electron density map for crystals soaked in the substrate for as short as 30 seconds showed the substrate clearly and indicated that the ring of central glucuronic acid assumes a distorted boat conformation. This structure strongly supports the lytic mechanism where Tyr242 acts as a general base that abstracts the proton from the C5 position of glucuronic acid while Asn183 and His233 neutralize the charge on the glucuronate acidic group. Comparison of this structure with that of chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum (FlavoAC) provides an explanation for the exolytic and endolytic mode of action of ArthroAC and FlavoAC, respectively.

	Abstract = {Reverse signaling by ephrin-As upon binding EphAs controls axon guidance and mapping. Ephrin-As are GPI-anchored to the membrane, requiring that they complex with transmembrane proteins that transduce their signals. We show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) serves this role in retinal axons. p75(NTR) and ephrin-A colocalize within caveolae along retinal axons and form a complex required for Fyn phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal changes. In vitro, retinal axon repulsion to EphAs by ephrin-A reverse signaling requires p75(NTR), but repulsion to ephrin-As by EphA forward signaling does not. Constitutive and retina-specific p75(NTR) knockout mice have aberrant anterior shifts in retinal axon terminations in superior colliculus, consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded ephrin-A reverse signaling induced by graded collicular EphAs. We conclude that p75(NTR) is a signaling partner for ephrin-As and the ephrin-A-p75(NTR) complex reverse signals to mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping.},

	Abstract = {Cathepsin K is the major collagenolytic enzyme produced by bone-resorbing osteoclasts. We showed earlier that the unique triple-helical collagen-degrading activity of cathepsin K depends on the formation of complexes with bone-or cartilage-resident glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S). Here, we describe the crystal structure of a 1:n complex of cathepsin K:C4-S inhibited by E64 at a resolution of 1.8 angstrom. The overall structure reveals an unusual "beads-on-a-string"-like organization. Multiple cathepsin K molecules bind specifically to a single cosine curve-shaped strand of C4-S with each cathepsin K molecule interacting with three disaccharicle residues of C4-S. One of the more important sets of interactions comes from a single turn of helix close to the N terminus of the proteinase containing a basic amino acid triplet (Arg8-Lys9-Lys10) that forms multiple hydrogen bonds either to the caboxylate or to the 4-sulfate groups of C4-S. Altogether, the binding sites with C4-S are located in the R-domain of cathepsin K and are distant from its active site. This explains why the general proteolytic activity of cathepsin K is not affected by the binding of chondroitin sulfate. Biochemical analyses of cathepsin K and C4-S mixtures support the presence of a 1:n complex in solution; a dissociation constant, K-d, of about 10 nM was determined for the interaction between cathepsin K and C4-S.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental question in developmental biology is how a limited number of growth factors and their cognate receptors coordinate the formation of tissues and organs endowed with enormous morphological complexity. We report that the related neurotrophins NGF and NT-3, acting through a common receptor, TrkA, are required for sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth and, thus, innervation of target fields. Yet, while NGF supports TrkA internalization and retrograde signaling from distal axons to cell bodies to promote neuronal survival, NT-3 cannot. Interestingly, final target-derived NGF promotes expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, in turn causing a reduction in the sensitivity of axons to intermediate target-derived NT-3. We propose that a hierarchical neurotrophin signaling cascade coordinates sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth, innervation of targets, and survival in a manner dependent on the differential control of TrkA internalization, trafficking, and retrograde axonal signaling.},

Silicon matrices are used to produce striped patterns of active molecules on a surface ( referred to as 'carpet'), followed by culturing of neurons, or any other cell type, on these carpets. After 1-2 days in culture, striped outgrowth of extending neurites indicative of guided migration of cell processes - can be observed. We also discuss potential other applications ( e. g., in neuronal regeneration and development) and modifications of the assay. The preparation of 10 - 12 carpets takes approximately 4 - 5 h.},

	Abstract = {In all mammals, much of the neocortex consists of orderly representations or maps of receptor surfaces that are typically topographic at a global level, while being modular at the local level. These representations appear to emerge in development as a result of a few interacting factors, and different aspects of brain maps may be developmentally linked, As a result, evolutionary selection for some map features may require other features that may not be adaptive. Yet, an overall adaptiveness of brain maps seems likely. Most notably, topographic representations permit interconnections between appropriate sets of neurons to be made in a highly efficient manner. Topographic maps provide an especially suitable substrate for the common spatiotemporal computations for neural circuits. Finally, aspects of perception suggest the functional importance of topographic maps.},

Its structure revealed three domains. The N-terminal domain has a fold similar to that of carbohydrate-binding domains of xylanases and some lectins, the middle and C-terminal domains are similar to the structures of the two-domain chondroitin lyase AC and bacterial hyaluronidases. Although the middle domain shows a very low level of sequence identity with the catalytic domains of chondroitinase AC and hyaluronidase, the residues implicated in catalysis of the latter enzymes are present in chondroitinase ABC I. The substrate-binding site in chondroitinase ABC I is in a wide-open cleft, consistent with the endolytic action pattern of this enzyme. The tryptophan residues crucial for substrate binding in chondroitinase AC and hyaluronidases are lacking in chondroitinase ABC I. The structure of chondroitinase ABC I provides a framework for probing specific functions of active-site residues for understanding the remarkably broad specificity of this enzyme and perhaps engineering a desired specificity. The electron density map showed clearly that the deposited DNA sequence for residues 495-530 of chondroitin ABC lyase I, the segment containing two putative active-site residues, contains a frame-shift error resulting in an incorrectly translated amino acid sequence. },

	Abstract = {The growth and guidance of axons involves the recognition of complex environmental cues by receptor proteins on the surface of the growth cone and their interpretation by cellular machinery, leading to changes in cellular behaviour, Recent advances have demonstrated that the ligands for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, the ephrins, act as repulsive axon guidance cues, and that Eph receptors are required for correct axonal navigation in vivo. Members of the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family also play important roles in axon guidance and growth, RPTP beta and Eph receptors interact with cell-surface-bound ligands, and there is increasing evidence that both transmembrane ephrins and contactin, a ligand for RPTP beta, may possess an intrinsic signalling function. Thus, the cell-contact-dependent interactions between these receptors and ligands may lead to initiation of bidirectional signals that regulate axonal growth and migration.},

	Abstract = {We report that EphB receptors direct unique axonal behaviors required for mapping the dorsal-ventral (D-V) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the superior colliculus (SC). EphBs are expressed in a D-V gradient, ephrin-B1 in a L-M gradient in SC, and ephrin-B3 at its midline. EphBs and ephrin-Bs are expressed in countergradients in retina and SC. Developmental analyses reveal that retinal axons lack D-V ordering along the L-M axis, but directionally extend branches along it to establish ordered arbors. Directed branch extension is disrupted in EphB2; EphB3-deficient mice resulting in lateral ectopic arbors. Mice with kinase-inactive EphB2 have similar D-V mapping defects indicating that forward signaling dominates over reverse signaling. Our data suggest that branches of EphB expressing axons are attracted medially by ephrin-B1, and provide molecular mechanisms for D-V mapping in visual centers.},

	Abstract = {Neurotrophins are secreted growth factors critical for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. Neurotrophins activate two types of cell surface receptors, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the shared p75 neurotrophin receptor. We have determined the 2.4 Angstrom crystal structure of the prototypic neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF), complexed with the extracellular domain of p75. Surprisingly, the complex is composed of an NGF homodimer asymmetrically bound to a single p75. p75 binds along the homodimeric interface of NGF, which disables NGF's symmetry-related second p75 binding site through an allosteric conformational change. Thus, neurotrophin signaling through p75 may occur by disassembly of p75 dimers and assembly of asymmetric 2: 1 neurotrophin/p75 complexes, which could potentially engage a Trk receptor to form a trimolecular signaling complex.},

@article{gong08,
	Abstract = {Neurotrophins (NTs) are important regulators for the survival, differentiation and maintenance of different peripheral and central neurons. NTs bind to two distinct classes of glycosylated receptor: the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks). Whereas p75(NTR) binds to all NTs, the Trk subtypes are specific for each NT1,2. The question of whether NTs stimulate p75(NTR) by inducing receptor homodimerization is still under debate. Here we report the 2.6-angstrom resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75(NTR). In contrast to the previously reported asymmetric complex structure, which contains a dimer of nerve growth factor (NGF) bound to a single ectodomain of deglycosylated p75(NTR) (ref. 3), we show that NT-3 forms a central homodimer around which two glycosylated p75(NTR) molecules bind symmetrically. Symmetrical binding occurs along the NT-3 interfaces, resulting in a 2:2 ligand-receptor cluster. A comparison of the symmetrical and asymmetric structures reveals significant differences in ligand receptor interactions and p75(NTR) conformations. Biochemical experiments indicate that both NT-3 and NGF bind to p75(NTR) with 2:2 stoichiometry in solution, whereas the 2:1 complexes are the result of artificial deglycosylation. We therefore propose that the symmetrical 2:2 complex reflects a native state of p75(NTR) activation at the cell surface. These results provide a model for NTs-p75(NTR) recognition and signal generation, as well as insights into coordination between p75(NTR) and Trks.},

	Abstract = {The precise contribution of different CS-GAGs to CSPG-mediated inhibition of axonal growth after CNS injury is unknown. Quantification of the CS-GAGs in uninjured and injured brain (scar tissue) using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) demonstrated that the dominant CS-GAG in the uninjured brain is CS-4 whereas, in glial scar, CS-2, CS-6, and CS-4,6 were over-expressed. To determine if the pattern of sulfation influenced neurite extension, we compared the effects of CS-GAGs with dominant CS-4, CS-6, or CS-4,6 sulfation to intact CSPG (aggrecan), chondroitin (CS-0), and hyaluronan on chick DRG neurite outgrowth. We report that CS-4,6 GAG, one of the upregulated CS-GAGs in astroglial scar, is potently inhibitor), and is comparable to intact aggrecan, a CSPG with known inhibitory properties. Thus, a specific CS-GAG that is differentially overexpressed in astroglial scar is a potent inhibitor of neurite extension. These results may influence the design of more specific strategies to enhance CNS regeneration after injury.},

Here, we assembled well-defined chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides using a convergent, synthetic approach that permits installation of sulfate groups at precise positions along the carbohydrate backbone. Using these defined structures, we demonstrate that specific sulfation motifs function as molecular recognition elements for growth factors and modulate neuronal growth. These results provide both fundamental insights into the role of sulfation and direct evidence for a `sulfation code' whereby glycosaminoglycans encode functional information in a sequence-specific manner analogous to that of DNA, RNA and proteins.},

	Abstract = {In this study, the multiple factors that govern the unidirectional path of intraretinal axons, as well as the cellular movements prior to and during early axonogenesis, were investigated using time-lapse videomicroscopy. For several hours prior to overt axon elongation, young retinal ganglion cells send out transient minor processes in all directions at the pial surface. Time-lapse analysis of the chondroitin sulfate (CS)-containing matrix that has been suggested to play an important role in regulating this early differentiative event revealed the dynamic, wavelike properties of this extracellular matrix component. As the CS matrix dissipates across the immature ganglion cells, only one minor process, away from the highest concentration of CS peripherally and in the direction of the optic fissure centrally, is retained and becomes the mature axon. Focal concentrations of L1 appear at points of neurite contact with previously established axons, suggesting that this growth-promoting molecule is also involved with establishing the precise, unidirectional outgrowth pattern of retinal ganglion cell axons. NCAM was diffusely distributed on neural elements and on the neuroepithelial endfeet in the central and peripheral retina and, thus, may not be an essential unidirectional axon growth cue. Growth cones mechanically deflected 180 degrees from the optic fissure after the CS wave had receded from the central retina had morphologies and rates of elongation similar to those oriented in the proper direction. Growth cones deflected obliquely toward the ventral retinal periphery entered a territory of increasing CS-containing proteoglycan matrix and neurons with minor processes. As these deflected axons entered more deeply into this region they slowed down and sent out long transient branchlike processes. These observations illustrate the complex organization of the changing cell surface and matrix components within the retina during axonogenesis and axon outgrowth. The results also elucidate the potential importance of a cell state where immature neurons probe their environment via minor processes. These specialized neurites may provide the neuron with a way to sample a full 360 degrees of terrain around them. This method of exploring the environment could afford the cell a mechanism with which to sample, summate, and respond to physical structures as well as simultaneously occurring negative and positive molecular influences that are distributed unequally on either side of the cell body.},

@article{braised97,
	Abstract = {Molecular gradients have been postulated to control the topographic mapping of retinal axons in their central targets. Based initially on their expression patterns, and more recently on functional studies, members of the EphA subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands have been implicated in the guidance of retinal axons along the anterior-posterior axis of the chick optic tectum. The report that a receptor of the EphB subfamily, EphB2/Cek5/Nuk/ Sek3, is expressed in a high ventral to low dorsal gradient in the developing chick retina and is present on ganglion cell axons suggests that it may be involved in the mapping of retinal axons along the corresponding dorsal-ventral axis of the tectum. To address this issue, we have determined the expression and distribution of ephrin-B1/LERK-2/Cek5-L and ephrin-B2/LERK-5/Htk-L/ELF-2, ligands for EphB2, in the developing chick retinotectal system using riboprobes, immunocytochemistry, and receptor affinity probes. Both ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the developing retina, complementary to the distribution of EphB2. Ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 proteins are predominantly found in the developing plexiform layers, suggesting a role in the development of intraretinal connections. Neither protein is detected on ganglion cell axons. In tectum, ephrin-B1 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the neuroepithelium and the protein is present along the processes of radial glia and is concentrated at their endfeet in the stratum opticum, at the time retinal axons are growing through it. This distribution of ephrin-B1 suggests that it influences retinal axon mapping along the dorsal-ventral tectal axis and may also be involved in intratectal development. In contrast, ephrin-B2 transcripts and protein are localized to the deeper retinorecipient laminae in the tectum at the time retinal axons begin to arborize in them, suggesting that this ligand may influence the laminar pattering of retinal axon terminations.},

	Abstract = {A striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the precision of the synaptic circuitry. In contemplating the mature circuitry, it is impossible to-imagine how more than 20 billion neurons in the human brain become precisely connected through trillions of synapses. Remarkably, much of the final wiring can be established in the absence of neural activity or experience; so the algorithms that allow precise connectivity must be encoded largely by the genetic programme. This programme, honed over nearly one billion years of evolution, generates networks with the flexibility to respond to a wide range of physiological challenges. There are several contemporary models of how synapse specificity is achieved, many of them proposed before the identification of guidance or recognition molecules. Here we review a selection of models as frameworks for defining the nature and complexity of synaptogenesis, and evaluate their validity in view of progress made in identifying the molecular underpinnings of axon guidance, targeting and synapse formation.},

	Abstract = {The theory developed by McGhee and von Hippel for ligand binding to a one-dimensional lattice-like macromolecule provides a closed 
analytical form in the Scatchard representation. The application of such theory has been complicated by two facts: (1) it has been practi- 
cally reduced to binding techniques, such as equilibrium dialysis, in which the partition between bound and free concentrations of all reac- 
tant species are directly accessible and experimentally determined, but infrequently applied to other binding techniques, such as calorimetry 
or spectroscopy, in which the direct observable is a magnitude proportional to the advance of the binding reaction monitored along the 
titration experiment, and (2) Scatchard analysis, developed as a quantitative graphical method, is currently outdated and used only qual- 
itatively because of its weaknesses, limitations, and deficiencies. However, a general exact method for applying such theory to titration 
techniques in a correct and precise manner, without any limitation, can be delineated. In this article, the theory of cooperative ligand bind- 
ing to linear lattice-like macromolecules has been implemented in isothermal titration calorimetry for the first time. This technique provides 
a complete thermodynamic characterization of ligand binding, but it has been barely used properly for this type of system. The description, 
the analysis of the formalism, and practical guidelines are presented, with considerations for experimental design and data analysis.},
