	Abstract = {A striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the precision of the synaptic circuitry. In contemplating the mature circuitry, it is impossible to-imagine how more than 20 billion neurons in the human brain become precisely connected through trillions of synapses. Remarkably, much of the final wiring can be established in the absence of neural activity or experience; so the algorithms that allow precise connectivity must be encoded largely by the genetic programme. This programme, honed over nearly one billion years of evolution, generates networks with the flexibility to respond to a wide range of physiological challenges. There are several contemporary models of how synapse specificity is achieved, many of them proposed before the identification of guidance or recognition molecules. Here we review a selection of models as frameworks for defining the nature and complexity of synaptogenesis, and evaluate their validity in view of progress made in identifying the molecular underpinnings of axon guidance, targeting and synapse formation.},

	Abstract = {Molecular gradients have been postulated to control the topographic mapping of retinal axons in their central targets. Based initially on their expression patterns, and more recently on functional studies, members of the EphA subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands have been implicated in the guidance of retinal axons along the anterior-posterior axis of the chick optic tectum. The report that a receptor of the EphB subfamily, EphB2/Cek5/Nuk/ Sek3, is expressed in a high ventral to low dorsal gradient in the developing chick retina and is present on ganglion cell axons suggests that it may be involved in the mapping of retinal axons along the corresponding dorsal-ventral axis of the tectum. To address this issue, we have determined the expression and distribution of ephrin-B1/LERK-2/Cek5-L and ephrin-B2/LERK-5/Htk-L/ELF-2, ligands for EphB2, in the developing chick retinotectal system using riboprobes, immunocytochemistry, and receptor affinity probes. Both ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the developing retina, complementary to the distribution of EphB2. Ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 proteins are predominantly found in the developing plexiform layers, suggesting a role in the development of intraretinal connections. Neither protein is detected on ganglion cell axons. In tectum, ephrin-B1 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the neuroepithelium and the protein is present along the processes of radial glia and is concentrated at their endfeet in the stratum opticum, at the time retinal axons are growing through it. This distribution of ephrin-B1 suggests that it influences retinal axon mapping along the dorsal-ventral tectal axis and may also be involved in intratectal development. In contrast, ephrin-B2 transcripts and protein are localized to the deeper retinorecipient laminae in the tectum at the time retinal axons begin to arborize in them, suggesting that this ligand may influence the laminar pattering of retinal axon terminations.},

	Abstract = {Prior to forming an axon, retinal ganglion cells retain a primitive radial configuration while maintaining ventricular and vitreal endfeet attachments. During their subsequent differentiation, ganglion cells polarize their cell body and axon only along the vitreal surface. When the ventricular surfaces of intact retinas in organ culture were exposed to free chondroitin sulfate (CS) in solution, both the cell body and nerve fiber layers were repolarized to the opposite side of the neuroepithelium. However, the basal lamina remained in its usual position. Thus, the ability to initiate an axon is not restricted to the vitreal endfoot region of differentiating neurons, and in addition, the radial position at which the axon emerges can be mediated by the location and concentration of the extracellular CS milieu.},

	Abstract = {In this study, the multiple factors that govern the unidirectional path of intraretinal axons, as well as the cellular movements prior to and during early axonogenesis, were investigated using time-lapse videomicroscopy. For several hours prior to overt axon elongation, young retinal ganglion cells send out transient minor processes in all directions at the pial surface. Time-lapse analysis of the chondroitin sulfate (CS)-containing matrix that has been suggested to play an important role in regulating this early differentiative event revealed the dynamic, wavelike properties of this extracellular matrix component. As the CS matrix dissipates across the immature ganglion cells, only one minor process, away from the highest concentration of CS peripherally and in the direction of the optic fissure centrally, is retained and becomes the mature axon. Focal concentrations of L1 appear at points of neurite contact with previously established axons, suggesting that this growth-promoting molecule is also involved with establishing the precise, unidirectional outgrowth pattern of retinal ganglion cell axons. NCAM was diffusely distributed on neural elements and on the neuroepithelial endfeet in the central and peripheral retina and, thus, may not be an essential unidirectional axon growth cue. Growth cones mechanically deflected 180 degrees from the optic fissure after the CS wave had receded from the central retina had morphologies and rates of elongation similar to those oriented in the proper direction. Growth cones deflected obliquely toward the ventral retinal periphery entered a territory of increasing CS-containing proteoglycan matrix and neurons with minor processes. As these deflected axons entered more deeply into this region they slowed down and sent out long transient branchlike processes. These observations illustrate the complex organization of the changing cell surface and matrix components within the retina during axonogenesis and axon outgrowth. The results also elucidate the potential importance of a cell state where immature neurons probe their environment via minor processes. These specialized neurites may provide the neuron with a way to sample a full 360 degrees of terrain around them. This method of exploring the environment could afford the cell a mechanism with which to sample, summate, and respond to physical structures as well as simultaneously occurring negative and positive molecular influences that are distributed unequally on either side of the cell body.},

	Abstract = {Neurotrophins are target-derived soluble polypeptides required for neuronal survival. Binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases initiate signaling cascades that promote cell survival and differentiation. All family members bind to another receptor (p75NTR), which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Hence, nerve growth factor (NGF) and related trophic factors are unique in that two separate receptor types are utilized. Although the biological function of p75NTR has been elusive, it has been suggested to mediate apoptosis of developing neurons in the absence of Trk receptors. This presents a tantalizing paradigm, in which life-death decisions of cells are dependent upon the expression and action of two different receptors with distinctive signaling mechanisms. In the presence of TrkA receptors, p75 can participate in the formation of high affinity binding sites and enhanced NGF responsiveness leading to a survival signal. In the absence of TrkA receptors, p75 can generate, in only specific cell populations, a death signal. Here we discuss the unique features and implications of this unusual signal transduction system.},

	Abstract = {The effects of removing chondroitin sulfate from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan molecules on guidance of retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic chiasm were investigated in a brain slice preparation of mouse embryos of embryonic day 13 to 15. Slices were grown for 5 hours and growth of dye-labeled axons was traced through the chiasm. After continuous enzymatic digestion of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC, which removes the glycosaminoglycan chains, navigation of retinal axons was disrupted. At embryonic day 13, before the uncrossed projection forms in normal development, many axons deviated from their normal course, crossing the midline at aberrant positions and invading the ventral diencephalon. In slices from embryonic day 14 embryos, axons that would normally form the uncrossed projection at this stage failed to turn into the ipsilateral optic tract. In embryonic day 15 slices, enzyme treatment caused a reduction of the uncrossed projection that develops at this stage. Growth cones in enzyme-treated slices showed a significant increase in the size both before and after they crossed the midline. This indicates that responses of retinal axons to guidance signals at the chiasm have changed after removal of the chondroitin sulfate epitope. We concluded that the chondroitin sulfate moieties of the proteoglycans are involved in patterning the early phase of axonal growth across the midline and at a later stage controlling the axon divergence at the chiasm.

Here, we assembled well-defined chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides using a convergent, synthetic approach that permits installation of sulfate groups at precise positions along the carbohydrate backbone. Using these defined structures, we demonstrate that specific sulfation motifs function as molecular recognition elements for growth factors and modulate neuronal growth. These results provide both fundamental insights into the role of sulfation and direct evidence for a `sulfation code' whereby glycosaminoglycans encode functional information in a sequence-specific manner analogous to that of DNA, RNA and proteins.},

	Abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are important complex carbohydrates that participate in many biological processes through the regulation of their various protein partners. Biochemical, structural biology and molecular modelling approaches have assisted in understanding the molecular basis of such interactions, creating an opportunity to capitalize on the large structural diversity of GAGs in the discovery of new drugs. The complexity of GAG-protein interactions is in part due to the conformational flexibility and underlying sulphation patterns of GAGs, the role of metal ions and the effect of pH on the affinity of binding. Current understanding of the structure of GAGs and their interactions with proteins is here reviewed: the basic structures and functions of GAGs and their proteoglycans, their clinical significance, the three-dimensional features of GAGs, their interactions with proteins and the molecular modelling of heparin binding sites and GAG-protein interactions. This review focuses on some key aspects of GAG structure-function relationships using classical examples that illustrate the specificity of GAG-protein interactions, such as growth factors, anti-thrombin, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. New approaches to the development of GAG mimetics as possible new glycotherapeutics are also briefly covered.},

@article{golding99,
	Abstract = {During mammalian hindbrain development, sensory axons grow along highly stereotyped routes within the cranial mesenchyme to reach their appropriate entry points into the neuroepithelium. Thus, trigeminal ganglion axons always project to rhombomere (r)2, whilst facial/acoustic ganglia axons always project to r4. Axons are never observed to enter the mesenchyme adjacent to r3, raising the possibility that r3 mesenchyme contains an axon growth-inhibitory activity. Conversely, in mice which lack the erbB4 receptor (normally expressed in r3), trigeminal and facial/acoustic ganglia axons misproject into r3 mesenchyme, suggesting that the putative axon barrier is absent. To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed an in vitro model in which dissociated wild-type embryonic trigeminal ganglion neurons are cultured on longitudinal cryosections of embryonic mouse head. We observed that on wild-type embryonic day 10 (E10) cryosections, neurites generally failed to grow into r3 mesenchyme from the adjacent r2 or r4 mesenchyme. This barrier was removed if cryosections were pretreated with chondroitinase or were washed with excess chondroitin 6-sulphate or hypertonic saline. By contrast, when trigeminal neurons were seeded onto cryosections of E10 erbB4 -/- embryo heads their neurites readily entered mutant r3 mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated chondroitin-sulphated proteoglycans throughout the cranial mesenchyme in both wild-type and erbB4 -/- embryos. We propose that trigeminal axons are excluded from wild-type r3 mesenchyme by a growth-inhibitory activity which associates with chondroitin-sulphated proteoglycans and that the synthesis of this activity may rely on signals transduced by erbB receptors.},

	Abstract = {We report that EphB receptors direct unique axonal behaviors required for mapping the dorsal-ventral (D-V) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the superior colliculus (SC). EphBs are expressed in a D-V gradient, ephrin-B1 in a L-M gradient in SC, and ephrin-B3 at its midline. EphBs and ephrin-Bs are expressed in countergradients in retina and SC. Developmental analyses reveal that retinal axons lack D-V ordering along the L-M axis, but directionally extend branches along it to establish ordered arbors. Directed branch extension is disrupted in EphB2; EphB3-deficient mice resulting in lateral ectopic arbors. Mice with kinase-inactive EphB2 have similar D-V mapping defects indicating that forward signaling dominates over reverse signaling. Our data suggest that branches of EphB expressing axons are attracted medially by ephrin-B1, and provide molecular mechanisms for D-V mapping in visual centers.},

	Abstract = {The current working model for fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) dimerization and activation requires the assembly of a ternary complex of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGFR, and heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) on the plasma membrane. The recent FGF2-FGFR1-heparin crystal structure provides a detailed but static view of the FGF-FGFR-heparin complex. However, the kinetics of ternary complex assembly has yet to be investigated. Here, we characterize FGF2, FGFR1, and heparin interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding constants for binary FGF2/FGFR1 (KD = 62 nM), FGF2/heparin (KD = 39 nM), and FGFR1/heparin (KD = 3.2 microM) interactions correlate to the magnitude of binding interface observed in the FGF2-FGFR1-heparin crystal structure. Interestingly, comparison of sensorgrams of sequential injections of FGF2 and FGFR1 and equimolar FGF2-FGFR1 injections onto a heparin neoproteoglycan surface demonstrates that FGF2 dramatically enhances the association of FGFR1 with heparin and leads us to propose a model for the stepwise assembly of a ternary FGF-FGFR-HSPG complex. The weak binding affinity of the FGFR1-heparin interaction suggests that in this model, FGFR and HSPG are unbound in the absence of FGF ligand. The availability of FGF results in formation of initial FGF-HSPG complexes, which promotes the rapid binding of FGFR and creates a ternary complex capable of undergoing dimerization and subsequent FGFR activation. In contrast, alternative models for the kinetic assembly of a ternary complex in which binary FGF-FGFR or FGFR-HSPG complexes are intermediates do not conform well with the experimental data.},

	Abstract = {The axons of the retinal ganglion cells run on the diencephalotelencephalic boundary on their way to the tectum; however, they do not invade the telencephalon anteriorly. To investigate the mechanisms that prevent the retinal axons from entering the telencephalic territory, the effects of the telencephalic cells were examined on the outgrowth of the retinal axons in vitro; the retinal outgrowth was selectively inhibited by the cellular substrate derived from the telencephalon. The responsible fac- tor for the selective inhibition was, furthermore, found in the telencephalic membranes and the fraction of peripheral membrane molecules from the telencephalon. Because the inhibitory effect was destroyed by chondroitinase ABC but not by heat, this inhibition was attributable to the carbohydrate chains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) adhering to the membranes of the telencephalic cells. To understand the function of the telencephalic CSPGs on the retinal pathfinding in vivo, their carbohydrate chains [chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG)] were removed from the embryonic brains by intraventricular injection of chondroitinase ABC; the removal of CS-GAG resulted in an anterior enlargement of the optic tract. The results indicate that the telencephalic cells delimit the anterior border of the optic tract with their CSPGs and prevent the retinal axons from aberrantly entering the anterior territory.

	Abstract = {Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans are major components of the cell surface and the extracellular matrix in the developing brain and bind to various proteins via CS chains in a CS structure-dependent manner. This study demonstrated the expression pattern of three CS sulfotransferase genes, dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase (D4ST), uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST), and N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), in the mouse postnatal cerebellum. These sulfotransferases are responsible for the biosynthesis of oversulfated structures in CS chains such as B, D, and E units, which constitute the binding sites for various heparin-binding proteins. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the expression of UST increased remarkably during cerebellar development. The amounts of B and D units, which are generated by UST activity, in the cerebellar CS chains also increased during development. In contrast, the expression of GalNAc4S-6ST and its biosynthetic product, E unit, decreased during postnatal development. In situ hybridization experiments revealed the levels of UST and GalNAc4S-6ST mRNAs to correlate inversely in many cells including Purkinje cells, granule cells in the external granular layer, and inhibitory interneurons. In these neurons, the expression of UST increased and that of GalNAc4S-6ST decreased during development and/or maturation. D4ST was also expressed by many neurons, but its expression was not simply correlated with development, which might contribute to the diversification of CS structures expressed by distinct neurons. These results suggest that the CS structures of various cerebellar neurons change during development and such changes of CS are involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways.},

@article{kantor05,
	Abstract = {The response of neuronal growth cones to axon guidance cues depends on the developmental context in which these cues are encountered. We show here that the transmembrane protein semaphorin 5A (Sema5A) is a bifunctional guidance cue exerting both attractive and inhibitory effects on developing axons of the fasciculus retroflexus, a diencephalon fiber tract associated with limbic function. The thrombospondin repeats of Sema5A physically interact with the glycosaminoglycan portion of both chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). CSPGs function as precisely localized extrinsic cues that convert Sema5A from an attractive to an inhibitory guidance cue. Therefore, glycosaminoglycan bound guidance cues provide a molecular mechanism for CSPG-mediated inhibition of axonal extension. Further, axonal HSPGs are required for Sema5A-mediated attraction, suggesting that HSPGs are components of functional Sema5A receptors. Thus, neuronal responses to Sema5A are proteoglycan dependent and interpreted according to the biological context in which this membrane bound guidance cue is presented. },

	Abstract = {Ephrin-B and EphB are distributed in matching dorsoventral gradients in the embryonic Xenopus visual system with retinal axons bearing high levels of ligand (dorsal) projecting to tectal regions with high receptor expression (ventral). In vitro stripe assays show that dorsal retinal axons prefer to grow on EphB receptor stripes supporting an attractive guidance mechanism. In vivo disruption of EphB/ephrin-B function by application of exogenous EphB or expression of dominant-negative ephrin-B ligand in dorsal retinal axons causes these axons to shift dorsally in the tectum, while misexpression of wild-type ephrin-B in ventral axons causes them to shift ventrally. These dorsoventral targeting errors are consistent with the hypothesis that an attractive mechanism that requires ephrin-B cytoplasmic domain is critical for retinotectal mapping in this axis.},

	Abstract = {Topographic maps are a fundamental organizational feature of axonal connections in the brain. A prominent model for studying axial polarity and topographic map development is the vertebrate retina and its projection to the optic tectum (or superior colliculus). Linked processes are controlled by molecules that are graded along the axes of the retina and its target fields. Recent studies indicate that ephrin-As control the temporal-nasal mapping of the retina in the optic tectum/superior colliculus by regulating the topographically-specific interstitial branching of retinal axons along the anterior-posterior tectal axis. This branching is mediated by relative levels of EphA receptor repellent signaling. A major recent advance is the demonstration that EphB receptor forward signaling and ephrin-B reverse signaling mediate axon attraction to control dorsal-ventral retinal mapping along the lateral-medial tectal axis. In addition, several classes of regulatory proteins have been implicated in the control of the axial patterning of the retina, and its ultimate readout of topographic mapping.},

	Abstract = {We report that the EphB receptor ligand, ephrin-B1, may act bifunctionally as both a branch repellent and attractant to control the unique mechanisms in mapping the dorsal-ventral (DV) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (LM) axis of the optic tectum. EphB receptors are expressed in a low to high DV gradient by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and ephrin-B1 is expressed in a low to high LM gradient in the tectum. RGC axons lack DV ordering along the LM tectal axis, but directionally extend interstitial branches that establish retinotopically ordered arbors. Recent studies show that ephrin-B1 acts as an attractant in DV mapping and in controlling directional branch extension. Modeling indicates that proper DV mapping requires that this attractant activity cooperates with a repellent activity in a gradient that mimics ephrin-B1. We show that ectopic domains of high, graded ephrin-B1 expression created by retroviral transfection repel interstitial branches of RGC axons and redirect their extension along the LM tectal axis, away from their proper termination zones (TZs). In contrast, the primary RGC axons are unaffected and extend through the ectopic domains of ephrin-B1 and arborize at the topographically correct site. However, when 2407 the location of a TZ is coincident with ectopic domains of ephrin-B1, the domains appear to inhibit arborization and shape the distribution of arbors. Our findings indicate that ephrin-B1 selectively controls, through either attraction or repulsion, the directional extension and arborization of interstitial branches extended by RGC axons arising from the same DV position: branches that arise from axons positioned lateral to the correct TZ are attracted up the gradient of ephrin-B1 and branches that arise from axons positioned medial to the same TZ are repelled down the ephrin-B1 gradient. Alternatively, EphB receptor signaling may act as a Iligand-density sensor' and titrate signaling pathways that promote branch extension toward an optimal ephrin-B1 concentration found at the TZ; branches located either medial or lateral to the TZ would encounter a gradient of increasingly favored attachment in the direction of the TZ.},

	Abstract = {During retinocollicular map development, spontaneous waves of action potentials spread across the retina, correlating activity among neighboring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To address the role of retinal waves in topographic map development, we examined wave dynamics and retinocollicular projections in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. beta2(-/-) mice lack waves during the first postnatal week, but RGCs have high levels of uncorrelated firing. By P8, the wild-type retinocollicular projection remodels into a refined map characterized by axons of neighboring RGCs forming focal termination zones (TZs) of overlapping arbors. In contrast, in P8 beta2(-/-) mice, neighboring RGC axons form large TZs characterized by broadly distributed arbors. At P8, glutamatergic retinal waves appear in beta2(-/-) mice, and later, visually patterned activity appears, but the diffuse TZs fail to remodel. Thus, spontaneous retinal waves that correlate RGC activity are required for retinotopic map remodeling during a brief early critical period.},

	Abstract = {Gradients of axon guidance molecules have long been postulated to control the development of the organization of neural connections into topographic maps. We review progress in identifying molecules required for mapping and the mechanisms by which they act, focusing on the visual system, the predominant model for map development. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, remain the only molecules that meet all criteria for graded topographic guidance molecules, although others fulfill some criteria. Recent reports further define their modes of action and new roles for them, including EphB/ephrin-B control of dorsal-ventral mapping, bidirectional signaling of EphAs/ephrinAs, bifunctional action of ephrins as attractants or repellents in a context-dependent manner, and complex interactions between multiple guidance molecules. In addition, spontaneous patterned neural activity has recently been shown to be required for map refinement during a brief critical period. We speculate on additional activities required for map development and suggest a synthesis of molecular and cellular mechanisms within the context of the complexities of map development.},

	Abstract = {Glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate are extracellular sugar chains involved in intercellular signalling. Disruptions of genes encoding enzymes that mediate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis have severe consequences in Drosophila and mice1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Mutations in the Drosophila gene sugarless, which encodes a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, impairs developmental signalling through the Wnt family member Wingless, and signalling by the fibroblast growth factor and Hedgehog pathways. Heparan sulphate is involved in these pathways6, 7, 8, but little is known about the involvement of chondroitin. Undersulphated and oversulphated chondroitin sulphate chains have been implicated in other biological processes, however, including adhesion of erythrocytes infected with malaria parasite to human placenta and regulation of neural development9, 10. To investigate chondroitin functions, we cloned a chondroitin synthase homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans and depleted expression of its product by RNA-mediated interference and deletion mutagenesis. Here we report that blocking chondroitin synthesis results in cytokinesis defects in early embryogenesis. Reversion of cytokinesis is often observed in chondroitin-depleted embryos, and cell division eventually stops, resulting in early embryonic death. Our findings show that chondroitin is required for embryonic cytokinesis and cell division.},

	Abstract = {Heparan sulfate (HS) plays essential roles in assisting herpes simplex virus infection and other biological processes. The biosynthesis of HS includes numerous specialized sulfotransferases that generate a variety of sulfated saccharide sequences, conferring the selectivity of biological functions of HS. We report a structural study of human HS 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform 3 (3-OST-3), a key sulfotransferase that transfers a sulfuryl group to a specific glucosamine in HS generating an entry receptor for herpes simplex virus 1. We have obtained the crystal structure of 3-OST-3 at 1.95 A in a ternary complex with 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate and a tetrasaccharide substrate. Mutational analyses were also performed on the residues involved in the binding of the substrate. Residues Gln255 and Lys368 are essential for the sulfotransferase activity and lie within hydrogen bonding distances to the carboxyl and sulfo groups of the uronic acid unit. These residues participate in the substrate recognition of 3-OST-3. This structure provides atomic level evidence for delineating the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism for 3-OST-3.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) containing N-acetylgalactosamine 4,6-bissulfate (GalNAc(4,6-SO(4))) show various physiological activities through interacting with numerous functional proteins. N-Acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST) transfers sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to position 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate in CS or DS to yield GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues. We here report generation of transgenic mice that lack GalNAc4S-6ST. GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were born normally and fertile. In GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice, GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in CS and DS disappeared completely, indicating that GalNAc4S-6ST should be a sole enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in both CS and DS. IdoA-GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) units that account for approximately 40\% of total disaccharide units of DS in the liver of the wild-type mice disappeared in the liver DS of GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice without reduction of IdoA content. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice contained CS without GlcA-GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) units. Tryptase and carboxypeptidase A activities of BMMCs derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were lower than those activities of BMMCs derived from wild-type mice, although mRNA expression of these mast cell proteases was not altered. Disaccharide compositions of heparan sulfate/heparin contained in the mast cells derived from BMMCs in the presence of stem cell factor were much different from those of heparan sulfate/heparin in BMMCs but did not differ significantly between wild-type mice and GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice. These observations suggest that CS containing GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in BMMCs may contribute to retain the active proteases in the granules of BMMCs but not for the maturation of BMMCs into connective tissue-type mast cells.},

	Abstract = {Soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), prepared from lo-d-old rat brain, were added to the culture medium of PCl2D cells containing NGF o examine the ef- fects on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from the cells. PC12D cells, a flat-shaped variant of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, are characteristic of prompt neurite formation in response not only to NGF, but also to CAMP-enhancing reagents such as forskolin. Brain CSPGs inhibited the neurite elongation irreversibly in a dose-dependent manner; complete inhibition was observed at a concentration of 50 nmol uranic acid/ml. Closely similar dose-dependent inhibition was observed in the forskolin-induced neurite outgrowth from PC12D cells. NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from conventional PC12 cells was also inhibited completely by 50 nmol uranic acid/ml CSPGs. Some brain CSPGs seemed to be inhibitory, but the cartilage-unique CSPG did not show any inhibitory effect. Chondroitin sulfate, a polysaccharide moiety of CSPGs, did not show any inhibitory effect even at a concentration of 250 nmol uranic acid/ml, while core proteins prepared from brain CSPGs by digestion with chondroitinase ABC exhibited inhibitory activity similar to that of intact CSPGs. This indicates that the site of the inhibitory activity exists in the core protein moiety of brain CSPGs. From these observations, it is conceivable that brain CSPGs are involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF $\pm$ heparin6,7 and FGF $\pm$ FGFR8,9 have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the FGF1 $\pm$ FGFR2 $\pm$ heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling. },

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, the glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate have been shown to bind and regulate the activities of many proteins. Established techniques have provided both qualitative and quantitative information regarding these interactions, leading to a general view that proteins bind with a variety of affinities to particular sequences within heparin or heparan sulfate chains. The mechanism by which heparan sulfate regulates the activity of proteins through such interactions has, however, proved more elusive. We survey some relevant details of the structural characteristics of heparin/heparan sulfate and the approaches used to investigate their interactions with proteins. For the latter, the interactions of heparin/heparan sulfate with fibroblast growth factors and their receptors will be emphasized, because these proteins have been the subject of many studies. We reflect on the information that various techniques have provided, points regarding their use, and some relevant theoretical considerations regarding the study of protein-heparin/heparan sulfate interactions. A perspective of new and developing approaches, which may aid advances in this field, is also provided.},

	Abstract = {Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) have been implicated in the processes of neural development in the brain. In this study, we characterized developmentally regulated brain CS/DS chains using a single chain antibody, GD3G7, produced by the phage display technique. Evaluation of the specificity of GD3G7 toward various glycosaminoglycan preparations showed that this antibody specifically reacted with squid CS-E (rich in the GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) disaccharide unit E), hagfish CS-H (rich in the IdoUAalpha1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) unit iE), and shark skin DS (rich in both E and iE units). In situ hybridization for the expression of N-acetylgalac-tosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase in the postnatal mouse brain, which is involved in the biosynthesis of CS/DS-E, showed a widespread expression of the transcript in the developing brain except at postnatal day 7, where strong expression was observed in the external granule cell layer in the cerebellum. The expression switched from the external to internal granule cell layer with development. Immunohistochemical localization of GD3G7 in the mouse brain showed that the epitope was relatively abundant in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. GD3G7 suppressed the growth of neurites in embryonic hippocampal neurons mediated by CS-E, suggesting that the epitope is embedded in the neurite outgrowth-promoting motif of CS-E. In addition, a CS-E decasaccharide fraction was found to be the critical minimal structure needed for recognition by GD3G7. Four discrete decasaccharide epitopic sequences were identified. The antibody GD3G7 has broad applications in investigations of CS/DS chains during the central nervous system's development and under various pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {Using molecular cloning techniques, human homologs of the known members of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors have been cloned and sequenced. Overall, there is a high degree of similarity between the human sequences and those from other mammals; however, there are differences in splicing patterns. There are two spliced forms of the extracellular domain of trkC in the human, a finding that has not been described in other species. In contrast, fewer spliced forms were detected of the intracellular domains of human trkB and trkC than has been described in other mammals. Northern analysis and in sifu hybridization experiments indicate that the human trks are expressed in a similar pattern to that described in other mammals. Expression of the trk extracellular domains as fusion proteins with IgG heavy chain yields soluble molecules that mimic intact trks in their binding specificity and affinity. These soluble chimeras block the biological activity of their cognate neurotrophin(s) in vitro. },

The key structural determinants responsible for protein binding, such as sulfate groups that participate in the interactions, were elucidated. Specificities were also readily compared across protein families or functional classes, and comparisons among glycosaminoglycan subclasses provided a more comprehensive understanding of protein specificity. To validate the approach, we showed that fibroblast growth factor family members have distinct sulfation preferences. We also demonstrated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate interact in a sulfation-dependent manner with various axon guidance proteins, including slit2, netrin1, ephrinA1, ephrinA5, and semaphorin5B. We anticipate that these microarrays will accelerate the discovery of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins and provide a deeper understanding of their roles in regulating diverse biological processes.},

@article{snow91,
	Abstract = {In the developing retina, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons elongate toward the optic fissure, even though no obvious directional restrictions exist. Previous studies indicate that axon-matrix interactions are important for retina] ganglion cell axon elongation, but the factors that direct elongation are unknown. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PG), a component of the extracellular matrix, repels elongating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons in vitro and is present in vivo in the roof plate of the spinal cord, a structure that acts as a barrier to DRG axons during development. In this study, we examined whether CS-PG may regulate the pattern of retinal ganglion cell outgrowth in the developing retina. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that CS-PG was present in the innermost layers of the developing rat retina. The expression of CS-PG moved peripherally with retinal development, always remaining at the outer edge of the front of the developing axons. CS-PG was no longer detectable with immunocytochemical techniques when RGC axon elongation in the retina is complete. Results of studies in vitro showed that CS-PG, isolated from bovine nasal cartilage and chick limb, was inhibitory to elongating RGC axons and that RGC growth cones were more sensitive to CS-PG than were DRG neurites tested at the same concentrations of CS-PG. The behavior of retinal growth cones as they encounter CS-PG was characterized using time-lapse video microscopy. Filopodia of the RGC growth cones extended to and sampled the CS-PG repeatedly. With time, the growth cones turned to avoid outgrowth on the CS-PG and grew only on laminin. While numerous studies have shown the presence of positive factors within the retina that may guide developing RGC axons, this is the first demonstration of an inhibitory or repelling molecule in the retina that may regulate axon elongation. Taken together, these data suggest that the direction of RGC outgrowth in the retina may be regulated by the proper ratio of growth-promoting molecules, such as laminin, to growth-inhibiting molecules, like CS-PG, present in the correct pattern and concentrations along the retinal ganglion cell pathway. Key words: chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, dorsal root ganglion, retina. },

	Abstract = {Sulfated proteoglycans (PGs) may play a significant role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. They are present in axon-free regions of the developing nervous system and repel elongating neurites in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The addition of growth-promoting molecules, such as laminin, can modify the inhibitory effect of PGs on neurite outgrowth (Snow, Steindler, and Silver, 1990b). Substrata containing a high-PG/low-laminin ratio completely inhibit neurite outgrowth, while normal, unimpeded outgrowth is observed on low-PG/high-laminin substrata. Therefore, different patterns of neurite outgrowth may result from regulation of the ratio of growth-promoting molecules to growth-inhibiting molecules. Using video microscopy, embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRG), chicken retinal ganglia neurons (RGC), and rat forebrain neurons (FB) were analyzed as they extended processes from a substratum consisting of laminin alone onto a step gradient of increasing concentrations of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PG) bound to laminin. In contrast to neurite outgrowth inhibition that occurs at the border of a single stripe of high concentration of CS-PG (Snow et al., 1990b and this study), growth cones grew onto and up CS-PG presented in a step-wise graded distribution. Although the behavior of the different cell types was unique, a common behavior of each cell type was a decrease in the rate of neurite outgrowth with increasing CS-PG concentration. These data suggest that appropriate concentrations of growth-promoting molecules combined with growth-inhibiting molecules may regulate the direction and possibly the timing of neurite outgrowth in vivo. The different responses of different neuronal types suggest that the presence of sulfated PG may have varying effects on different aspects of neuronal development.},

@article{vaudry02,
	Abstract = {A key issue in signal transduction is how signaling pathways common to many systems-so-called canonical signaling cassettes-integrate signals from molecules having a wide spectrum of activities, such as hormones and neurotrophins, to deliver distinct biological outcomes. The neuroendocrine cell line PC12, derived from rat pheochromocytoma, provides an example of how one canonical signaling cassette-the Raf --> mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) --> extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway-can promote distinct outcomes, which in this case include neuritogenesis, gene induction, and proliferation. Two growth hormones, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), use the same pathway to cause PC12 proliferation and differentiation, respectively. In addition, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neurotransmitter that also causes differentiation, uses the same canonical cassette as NGF but in a different way. The Connections Map for PC12 Cell Differentiation brings into focus the complex array of specific cellular responses that rely on canonical signal transduction systems.},
